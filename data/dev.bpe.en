La@@ st year I sho@@ wed these two sli@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 st@@ ates , has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent .
But this under@@ st@@ ates the ser@@ i@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ice .
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
It exp@@ ands in win@@ ter and con@@ trac@@ ts in su@@ mmer .
The next sli@@ de I show you will be a r@@ ap@@ id fa@@ st-@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
As you see , it exp@@ ands to the dar@@ k bl@@ ue --
that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in win@@ ter ,
and it con@@ trac@@ ts in su@@ mmer .
The s@@ o-@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice , five years old or ol@@ der , you can see is almost like bl@@ ood , sp@@ il@@ ling out of the body here .
In 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
This is a problem because the war@@ ming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an , where there is a mas@@ sive amount of fro@@ zen carb@@ on which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into meth@@ an@@ e by micro@@ bes .
Com@@ par@@ ed to the tot@@ al amount of global war@@ ming pol@@ lu@@ tion in the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here , that amount could d@@ ou@@ ble if we cr@@ os@@ s this ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ al@@ low la@@ kes in A@@ la@@ sk@@ a , meth@@ an@@ e is acti@@ vely bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water .
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey W@@ al@@ ter from the Uni@@ versity of A@@ la@@ sk@@ a went out with another team to another sh@@ al@@ low la@@ ke last win@@ ter .
V@@ ide@@ o : W@@ ho@@ a ! Al G@@ ore : She &apos;s ok@@ ay . The question is whether we will be .
And one reason is , this enor@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ ats up Gre@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th .
This is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting ri@@ ver .
But the volu@@ mes are much lar@@ ger than ever .
This is the K@@ an@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in s@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ st Gre@@ en@@ land .
If you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ ba@@ se ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the sea .
These flo@@ ws are incre@@ as@@ ing very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly .
At the other end of the planet , An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the lar@@ ge@@ st ma@@ ss of ice on the planet .
La@@ st m@@ ont@@ h scienti@@ sts re@@ por@@ ted the entire contin@@ ent is now in neg@@ ative ice bal@@ ance .
And we@@ st An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pp@@ ed up on top some under@@ -@@ sea is@@ land@@ s , is parti@@ cul@@ arly r@@ ap@@ id in its mel@@ ting .
That &apos;s equ@@ al to 20 feet of sea level , as is Gre@@ en@@ land .
In the H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ as , the third lar@@ ge@@ st ma@@ ss of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ ers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from that mel@@ ting f@@ low .
In the An@@ des , this g@@ l@@ ac@@ ier is the sour@@ ce of drin@@ king water for this city .
The flo@@ ws have incre@@ as@@ ed .
But when they go away , so does much of the drin@@ king water .
In Californi@@ a there has been a 40 percent dec@@ line in the Si@@ er@@ ra s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ack .
This is h@@ it@@ ting the re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s .
And the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are ser@@ ious .
This dr@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a dra@@ mati@@ c incre@@ ase in fi@@ res .
And the di@@ sa@@ sters around the world have been incre@@ as@@ ing at an absolu@@ tely ex@@ tra@@ ordinary and un@@ prec@@ e@@ den@@ ted r@@ ate .
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5 .
This is a completely un@@ su@@ sta@@ in@@ able patter@@ n .
If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million t@@ ons of CO@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 hours --
25 million t@@ ons every day to the oce@@ ans . L@@ ook car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at the area of the ea@@ ster@@ n P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic , from the Amer@@ ic@@ as , ex@@ ten@@ ding we@@ st@@ ward , and on either side of the Indi@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent , where there is a ra@@ dic@@ al de@@ ple@@ tion of ox@@ y@@ gen in the oce@@ ans .
The bi@@ gge@@ st single c@@ ause of global war@@ ming , along with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the bur@@ ning of f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
O@@ il is a problem , and co@@ al is the most ser@@ ious problem .
The United States is one of the two lar@@ ge@@ st em@@ it@@ ters , along with China .
And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al plan@@ ts .
But we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
Here are the ones that have been can@@ cel@@ led in the last few years with some green al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves pro@@ posed .
Ho@@ we@@ ver there is a polit@@ ical bat@@ tle in our country .
And the co@@ al indu@@ str@@ ies and the oil indu@@ str@@ ies spent a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ en@@ da@@ r year prom@@ ot@@ ing cle@@ an co@@ al , which is an ox@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
That image re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
Ar@@ ound Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s , in my home in T@@ en@@ ne@@ s@@ see , a billion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ il@@ led .
You probably saw it on the news .
This , all over the country , is the second lar@@ ge@@ st wa@@ ste stre@@ am in America .
This happened around Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s .
One of the co@@ al indu@@ stry &apos;s ads around Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s was this one .
V@@ ide@@ o : ♪ ♫ F@@ ro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy s@@ ou@@ l .
He &apos;s ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant here in America , and he hel@@ ps our economy grow .
F@@ ro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is getting cle@@ an@@ er every@@ day .
He &apos;s af@@ for@@ d@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and wor@@ kers keep their pa@@ y .
Al G@@ ore : This is the sour@@ ce of much of the co@@ al in W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
The lar@@ ge@@ st m@@ oun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of M@@ as@@ se@@ y C@@ o@@ al .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ on B@@ lan@@ ken@@ ship : Let me be clear about it . Al G@@ ore , N@@ anc@@ y P@@ el@@ os@@ i , Har@@ ry Re@@ id , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al G@@ ore : So the Al@@ li@@ ance for C@@ lim@@ ate P@@ rot@@ ec@@ tion has la@@ un@@ ched two cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns .
This is one of them , part of one of them .
V@@ ide@@ o : Ac@@ tor : At CO@@ A@@ L@@ erg@@ y we view climate change as a very ser@@ ious th@@ re@@ at to our business .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our pri@@ mar@@ y go@@ al to spend a large sum of money on an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing ef@@ for@@ t to help bring out and comp@@ lic@@ ate the tru@@ th about co@@ al .
The fact is , co@@ al isn &apos;t di@@ r@@ ty .
We think it &apos;s cle@@ an -- sm@@ el@@ ls good , too .

But that &apos;s the sound of cle@@ an co@@ al technology .
And while bur@@ ning co@@ al is one of the lea@@ ding cau@@ ses of global war@@ ming , the re@@ mark@@ able cle@@ an co@@ al technology you see here changes everything .
Ta@@ ke a good long look : this is today &apos;s cle@@ an co@@ al technology .
Al G@@ ore : F@@ in@@ ally , the pos@@ itive al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative mes@@ he@@ s with our economic challen@@ ge and our national sec@@ ur@@ ity challen@@ ge .

Thank you very much .
La@@ st year at TED I gave an introduc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I prom@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that machine worked .
So this is it . And for those of you that wer@@ en &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ ge@@ st scienti@@ fic experiment ever at@@ temp@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 kilome@@ ters in cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence .
I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the condi@@ tions that were present less than a bil@@ li@@ ont@@ h of a second after the universe began , up to 6@@ 00 million times a second .
It &apos;s nothing if not am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous .
This is the machine bel@@ ow G@@ en@@ ev@@ a .
We take the pic@@ tures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ ig B@@ an@@ gs inside de@@ tec@@ tors . This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ tec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wi@@ de , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in dia@@ meter .
Sp@@ ec@@ t@@ acu@@ lar picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under construc@@ tion so you can see the scale .
O@@ n the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It cau@@ sed im@@ men@@ se cel@@ e@@ br@@ ation in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am par@@ tic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C del@@ i@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing par@@ tic@@ les into the de@@ tec@@ tor .
In other words , when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h .
I don &apos;t know whether this got the bi@@ gge@@ st ch@@ eer , or this , when someone went on@@ to Google and saw the front pa@@ ge was like that .
It means we made cultur@@ al impact as well as scienti@@ fic impact .
A@@ b@@ out a week later we had a problem with the machine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of w@@ ire here -- these g@@ old wi@@ res .
Th@@ ose wi@@ res car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thous@@ and am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
Now the engin@@ e@@ ers am@@ on@@ g@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wi@@ res . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are what &apos;s called super@@ con@@ duc@@ ting w@@ ire .
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the st@@ ars , those wi@@ res can take that curr@@ ent .
In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ ne@@ ts in L@@ H@@ C , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect .
So the w@@ ire he@@ ated up sli@@ gh@@ tly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps su@@ d@@ den@@ ly en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed electr@@ ical resi@@ st@@ ance .
This was the resul@@ t .
Now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ sive when you consi@@ der those mag@@ ne@@ ts we@@ ig@@ h over 20 t@@ ons , and they mo@@ ved about a f@@ oot .
So we da@@ ma@@ ged about 50 of the mag@@ ne@@ ts .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We re@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again .
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on , and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or Ju@@ ly , and contin@@ ue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building b@@ loc@@ ks of the universe are .
Now of course , in a way those ac@@ ci@@ den@@ ts re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the value of science and engin@@ eer@@ ing at the ed@@ ge . It &apos;s easy to re@@ fu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C .
I will leave the fin@@ al word to an Eng@@ lish scienti@@ st , Hu@@ mp@@ h@@ re@@ y Dav@@ y , who , I su@@ sp@@ ect , when de@@ fen@@ ding his prot@@ e@@ ge &apos;s u@@ sel@@ ess experi@@ ments -- his prot@@ e@@ ge was Mi@@ cha@@ el F@@ ar@@ a@@ day -- said this , &quot; No@@ thing is so dan@@ ger@@ ous to the pro@@ gre@@ ss of the human mind than to as@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ ti@@ mate , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s are comple@@ te , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a k@@ id , pla@@ ying with b@@ loc@@ ks .
As you fig@@ u@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gra@@ s@@ p , pic@@ k them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and sol@@ ve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relation@@ shi@@ ps .
S@@ pati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ ep@@ ly connec@@ ted to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer scienti@@ st in@@ spi@@ red by this ut@@ il@@ ity of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with phys@@ ical objec@@ ts -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ at@@ tie , and my col@@ labor@@ ator J@@ e@@ e@@ van K@@ al@@ an@@ i@@ th@@ i -- I started to w@@ onder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one m@@ ou@@ se cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a dig@@ ital f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at de@@ sk@@ top , what if we could re@@ ach in with both hands and gra@@ s@@ p information phys@@ ically ,
ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
This question was so comp@@ el@@ ling that we decided to expl@@ ore the answer , by building Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
In a nu@@ ts@@ hel@@ l , a Si@@ f@@ table is an inter@@ acti@@ ve computer the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
They &apos;re able to be mo@@ ved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their mot@@ ion , and they have a scre@@ en and a w@@ ir@@ el@@ ess radi@@ o .
M@@ ost import@@ an@@ tly , they &apos;re phys@@ ical , so like the b@@ loc@@ ks , you can move them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gra@@ sp@@ ing .
And Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ osy@@ stem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating dig@@ ital information .
And as these tools become more phys@@ ical , more a@@ ware of their mot@@ ion , a@@ ware of each other , and a@@ ware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to expl@@ ore some new and fun inter@@ action st@@ y@@ les .
So , I &apos;m going to start with some simple exam@@ p@@ les .
This Si@@ f@@ table is conf@@ ig@@ u@@ red to show video , and if I t@@ il@@ t it in one direc@@ tion , it &apos;ll ro@@ ll the video this way ; if I t@@ il@@ t it the other way it ro@@ l@@ ls it back@@ wards .
And these inter@@ acti@@ ve por@@ tra@@ its are a@@ ware of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
If they get sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded , they not@@ ice that too , they might get a little f@@ lu@@ ster@@ ed .
And they can also sense their mot@@ ion and t@@ il@@ t .
One of the interesting imp@@ lic@@ ations on inter@@ action , we started to re@@ alize , was that we could use every@@ day ge@@ stu@@ res on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a col@@ or the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ id .
So in this case , we &apos;ve got three Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les conf@@ ig@@ u@@ red to be pa@@ int b@@ uc@@ ke@@ ts and I can use them to p@@ our col@@ or into that centr@@ al one , where they get mi@@ x@@ ed .
If we over@@ sh@@ oot , we can p@@ our a little bit back .
There are also some ne@@ at pos@@ sibil@@ ities for education , like language , mat@@ h and lo@@ gic g@@ ames where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the resul@@ ts im@@ medi@@ ately .
So here I &apos;m -- This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ acc@@ i sequ@@ ence that I &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
Here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -@@ up between S@@ cra@@ b@@ ble and B@@ og@@ g@@ le .
B@@ as@@ ically , in every r@@ ound you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned let@@ ter on each Si@@ f@@ table , and as you try to make words it ch@@ ec@@ ks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
Then , after about 30 sec@@ onds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new pos@@ sibil@@ ities to try .
Thank you .
So these are some kids that came on a field tri@@ p to the Me@@ dia La@@ b , and I man@@ a@@ ged to get them to try it out , and sh@@ oot a video .
They really lo@@ ved it .
And , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
All you have to say is , &quot; Ma@@ ke words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
That &apos;s our youn@@ ge@@ st bet@@ a te@@ ster , down there on the right .
T@@ ur@@ ns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les up .
So to him , they were just b@@ loc@@ ks .
Now , this is an inter@@ acti@@ ve car@@ t@@ oon app@@ lic@@ ation .
And we wanted to build a learning t@@ ool for language lear@@ ners .
And this is F@@ el@@ i@@ x , actually .
And he can bring new charac@@ ters into the sc@@ ene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les off the table that have that charac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them .
Here , he &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the su@@ n out .
V@@ ide@@ o : The su@@ n is ri@@ sing .
David M@@ er@@ r@@ ill : Now he &apos;s brought a trac@@ tor into the sc@@ ene .
V@@ ide@@ o : The or@@ an@@ ge trac@@ tor .
G@@ ood job ! Yeah !
D@@ M : So by sha@@ king the Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les and pu@@ tting them next to each other he can make the charac@@ ters inter@@ act -- V@@ ide@@ o : W@@ oo@@ f !
D@@ M : inven@@ ting his own n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative .
V@@ ide@@ o : H@@ el@@ l@@ o !
D@@ M : It &apos;s an open@@ -@@ en@@ ded story ,
and he gets to deci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
V@@ ide@@ o : F@@ ly away , c@@ at .
D@@ M : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ enc@@ ing and live per@@ for@@ man@@ ce t@@ ool that we &apos;ve built rec@@ ently , in which Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les act as s@@ ounds like le@@ ad , bas@@ s and dru@@ ms .
E@@ ach of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to cho@@ ose which one you want to use .
And you can in@@ ject these s@@ ounds into a sequ@@ ence that you can as@@ se@@ mb@@ le into the patter@@ n that you want .
And you in@@ ject it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound Si@@ f@@ table against a sequ@@ ence Si@@ f@@ table . There are effec@@ ts that you can control live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
You att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then t@@ il@@ t to ad@@ just it .
And then , over@@ all effec@@ ts like temp@@ o and volu@@ me that app@@ ly to the entire sequ@@ ence .
So let &apos;s have a look .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : We &apos;ll start by pu@@ tting a le@@ ad into two sequ@@ ence Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les , ar@@ ran@@ ge them into a ser@@ ies , ex@@ tend it , ad@@ d a little more le@@ ad .
Now I put a bas@@ s line in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : Now I &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dru@@ ms , so I can control the effect live .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can spe@@ ed up the whole sequ@@ ence by t@@ il@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pres@@ sion .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the sequ@@ ence while it pla@@ ys .
So I don &apos;t have to plan it out in ad@@ van@@ ce , but I can im@@ provi@@ se , making it longer or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go .
And now , finally , I can fa@@ de the whole sequ@@ ence out using the volu@@ me Si@@ f@@ table , t@@ il@@ ted to the left .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my pas@@ sion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bo@@ dies work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the pos@@ sibil@@ ities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the labor@@ ator@@ y .
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of tools for inter@@ ac@@ ting with dig@@ ital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
Thank you very much .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
I am a wr@@ it@@ er .
W@@ rit@@ ing books is my profes@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great li@@ f@@ el@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation . And I don &apos;t exp@@ ect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened rec@@ ently in my life and in my car@@ eer , which has cau@@ sed me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relation@@ ship with this work .
And the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I rec@@ ently wrote this book , this me@@ mo@@ ir called &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , L@@ o@@ ve &quot; which , dec@@ ide@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ s@@ ation , inter@@ national be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler thing .
The resul@@ t of which is that every@@ where I go now , people tre@@ at me like I &apos;m d@@ oo@@ m@@ ed .
S@@ er@@ i@@ ously -- d@@ oo@@ m@@ ed , d@@ oo@@ m@@ ed !
Li@@ ke , they come up to me now , all wor@@ r@@ ied , and they say , &quot; A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re going to keep wr@@ iting for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all ,
ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
But it would be wor@@ se , ex@@ cept for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I was a te@@ en@@ a@@ ger , when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a wr@@ it@@ er , I was met with this same sort of fe@@ ar-@@ based re@@ action .
And people would say , &quot; A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re never going to have any succ@@ ess ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id the hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will k@@ ill you ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this cra@@ ft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of bro@@ ken dre@@ ams with your m@@ outh fil@@ led with bit@@ ter as@@ h of fa@@ il@@ ure ? &quot;
Li@@ ke that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id of many , many more things be@@ si@@ des that people can &apos;t even gu@@ ess at ,
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary .
But , when it comes to wr@@ iting , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wonder@@ ing about l@@ ately ,
is why ? You know , is it r@@ ational ?
Is it log@@ ical that anybody should be exp@@ ected to be af@@ ra@@ id of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
And what is it specif@@ ically about cre@@ ative ven@@ tures that seem@@ s to make us really n@@ erv@@ ous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Li@@ ke my da@@ d , for example , was a chem@@ ical engin@@ eer and I don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chem@@ ical engin@@ eer@@ ing anybody as@@ king him if he was af@@ ra@@ id to be a chem@@ ical engin@@ eer , you know ?
&quot; That chem@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ engin@@ eer@@ ing b@@ lock , John , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be fa@@ ir , chem@@ ical engin@@ e@@ ers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a re@@ pu@@ tation over the centur@@ ies for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
We wr@@ it@@ ers , we kind of do have that re@@ pu@@ tation ,
and not just wr@@ it@@ ers , but cre@@ ative people across all gen@@ res , it seem@@ s , have this re@@ pu@@ tation for being enor@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able .
And all you have to do is look at the very g@@ ri@@ m death coun@@ t in the 20@@ th century al@@ one , of really mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds
who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t literally comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de se@@ em to be really un@@ done by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
Nor@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , last inter@@ view , he said , &quot; E@@ very one of my books has kil@@ led me a little more . &quot;
A@@ n ex@@ tra@@ ordinary stat@@ e@@ ment to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even bl@@ in@@ k when we hear somebody say this ,
because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and some@@ how we &apos;ve completely inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized and ac@@ cep@@ ted collec@@ ti@@ vely
this not@@ ion that creati@@ vity and su@@ ff@@ ering are some@@ how in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely le@@ ad to an@@ gu@@ ish .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
A@@ re you com@@ for@@ table with that ?
Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all com@@ for@@ table with that as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
And I also think it &apos;s dan@@ ger@@ ous ,
and I don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to live .
And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that , in my case -- in my situ@@ ation -- it would be very dan@@ ger@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dar@@ k pat@@ h
of as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , parti@@ cul@@ arly given the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ ance that I &apos;m in right now in my car@@ eer .
Wh@@ ich is -- you know , like ch@@ ec@@ k it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four de@@ ca@@ des of work left in me .
And it &apos;s exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly li@@ kel@@ y that anything I write from this point forward is going to be ju@@ d@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the f@@ re@@ ak@@ ish succ@@ ess of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly li@@ kel@@ y that my gre@@ at@@ est succ@@ ess is behind me .
So J@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
That &apos;s the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a person to start drin@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ lock in the morning ,
and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would pre@@ f@@ er to keep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question be@@ comes , how ?
And so , it seem@@ s to me , up@@ on a lot of ref@@ lec@@ tion , that the way that I have to work now , in order to contin@@ ue wr@@ iting , is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ec@@ tive psych@@ olog@@ ical construc@@ t , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe dist@@ ance between me , as I am wr@@ iting , and my very natural an@@ x@@ iety about what the re@@ action to that wr@@ iting is going to be , from now on .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for model@@ s for how to do that ,
I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other soc@@ ie@@ ties to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ideas than we have about how to help cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent emot@@ ion@@ al ris@@ ks of creati@@ vity .
And that search has led me to anci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e and anci@@ ent R@@ ome .
So sta@@ y with me , because it does cir@@ cle around and back .
But , anci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e and anci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happen to believe that creati@@ vity came from human be@@ ings back then , OK ?
People belie@@ ved that creati@@ vity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spir@@ it that came to human be@@ ings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble sour@@ ce , for dist@@ ant and un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble reas@@ ons .
The G@@ ree@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spir@@ its of creati@@ vity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
S@@ oc@@ r@@ ates , fam@@ ously , belie@@ ved that he had a da@@ em@@ on who sp@@ o@@ ke wis@@ dom to him from af@@ ar .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea ,
but they called that sort of dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died cre@@ ative spir@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us .
Wh@@ ich is great , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a parti@@ cul@@ arly cle@@ ver individu@@ al .
They belie@@ ved that a gen@@ i@@ us was this , sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine en@@ t@@ ity , who was belie@@ ved to literally live in the wal@@ ls of an arti@@ st &apos;s stu@@ di@@ o ,
kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f ,
and who would come out and sort of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bly as@@ si@@ st the arti@@ st with their work
and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
So br@@ illi@@ ant -- there it is , right there , that dist@@ ance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psych@@ olog@@ ical construc@@ t to prot@@ ect you from the resul@@ ts of your work .
And everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tion@@ ed , right ?
So the anci@@ ent arti@@ st was prot@@ ected from certain things , like , for example , too much n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ m , right ?
If your work was br@@ illi@@ ant , you couldn &apos;t take all the cre@@ dit for it ,
everybody knew that you had this dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ ped you .
If your work b@@ om@@ bed , not enti@@ rel@@ y your fa@@ ul@@ t , you know ?
E@@ very@@ one knew your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of la@@ me .
And this is how people thought about creati@@ vity in the W@@ est for a really long time .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed ,
and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individu@@ al human being at the center of the universe ab@@ o@@ ve all go@@ ds and my@@ ster@@ ies ,
and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ st@@ ical creat@@ ures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
And it &apos;s the beginning of r@@ ational human@@ ism ,
and people started to believe that creati@@ vity came completely from the self of the individu@@ al .
And for the first time in history , you start to hear people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us , rather than having a gen@@ i@@ us .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge er@@ ro@@ r .
You know , I think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ve@@ ss@@ el , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the essen@@ ce and the sour@@ ce of all di@@ v@@ ine , cre@@ ative , un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble , e@@ ter@@ n@@ al my@@ ster@@ y is just a s@@ mid@@ ge too much respon@@ sibility to put on one fra@@ g@@ ile , human psych@@ e .
It &apos;s like as@@ king somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the su@@ n .
It just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s , and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ a@@ ge@@ able exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
And I think the press@@ ure of that has been kil@@ ling off our arti@@ sts for the last 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question be@@ comes , what now ?
Can we do this differ@@ ently ?
Ma@@ ybe go back to some more anci@@ ent understanding about the relation@@ ship between humans and the cre@@ ative my@@ ster@@ y .
Ma@@ ybe not .
Ma@@ ybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of r@@ ational human@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 18 minu@@ te spe@@ ec@@ h .
And there &apos;s probably people in this audi@@ ence who would ra@@ ise really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate scienti@@ fic su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ons about the not@@ ion of , basically , fa@@ ir@@ ies who fol@@ low people around ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing fa@@ ir@@ y ju@@ ice on their projec@@ ts and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to p@@ ose is --
you know , why not ?
Why not think about it this way ?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the ut@@ ter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ r@@ ici@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss of the cre@@ ative process .
A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have r@@ ation@@ ally .
And , in fact , can sometimes feel do@@ w@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al . I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ ently
where I met the ex@@ tra@@ ordinary American po@@ et R@@ u@@ th St@@ one ,
who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life
and she told me that when she was growing up in r@@ ural V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia ,
she would be out working in the fi@@ el@@ ds , and she said she would feel and hear a p@@ oe@@ m coming at her from over the land@@ sc@@ ape .
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of air .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the land@@ sc@@ ape .
And she f@@ elt it coming , because it would sha@@ ke the e@@ arth under her feet . She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hel@@ l . &quot;
And she would run like hel@@ l to the house and she would be getting ch@@ as@@ ed by this p@@ oe@@ m , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ ci@@ l
fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collec@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the pa@@ ge .
And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough ,
so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house
and the p@@ oe@@ m would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would contin@@ ue on across the land@@ sc@@ ape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ents where she would almost mis@@ s it , right ?
So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the p@@ oe@@ m pas@@ ses through her ,
and she gra@@ bs a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it &apos;s going through her ,
and then she said , it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other hand and she would cat@@ ch it .
She would cat@@ ch the p@@ oe@@ m by its ta@@ il , and she would pul@@ l it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the pa@@ ge .
And in these in@@ stan@@ ces , the p@@ oe@@ m would come up on the pa@@ ge perfect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my cre@@ ative process is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my cre@@ ative process is -- I &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine !
I &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and s@@ we@@ at and la@@ b@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really a@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly .
But even I , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even I have bru@@ shed up against that thing , at times .
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too . You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a sour@@ ce that I hon@@ est@@ ly cannot iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us l@@ ose our min@@ ds ,
but , in fact , might actually keep us s@@ an@@ e ?
And for me , the best con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the m@@ us@@ ici@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ its ,
who I got to inter@@ view sever@@ al years ago on a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine as@@ sign@@ ment .
And we were talking about this ,
and you know , T@@ om , for most of his life , he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ men@@ ted con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary moder@@ n arti@@ st , trying to control and man@@ age and dom@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ contro@@ l@@ la@@ ble cre@@ ative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were tot@@ ally inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized .
But then he got ol@@ der , he got cal@@ mer ,
and one day he was dri@@ ving down the f@@ ree@@ way in L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es , and this is when it all changed for him .
And he &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding along , and all of a su@@ dden he he@@ ars this little fra@@ g@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy ,
that comes into his head as inspir@@ ation often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and tan@@ tal@@ iz@@ ing ,
and he wan@@ ts it , it &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous ,
and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , or a pen@@ ci@@ l , or a t@@ ape rec@@ order .
So he star@@ ts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ iety start to ri@@ se in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to l@@ ose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this s@@ ong for@@ ever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of pan@@ ic@@ king , he just stop@@ ped . He just stop@@ ped that whole mental process and he did something completely nov@@ el .
He just looked up at the sk@@ y , and he said , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , can you not see that I &apos;m dri@@ ving ? &quot;
&quot; Do I look like I can write down a s@@ ong right now ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist , come back at a more opportun@@ e moment when I can take care of you .
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard C@@ o@@ hen . &quot; And his whole work process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dar@@ k as ever .
But the process , and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ iety around it was rel@@ eas@@ ed when he took the gen@@ ie , the gen@@ i@@ us out of him
where it was cau@@ sing nothing but tr@@ ou@@ ble , and rel@@ eas@@ ed it back where it came from ,
and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized , tor@@ men@@ ted thing .
It could be this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re col@@ labor@@ ation , kind of con@@ vers@@ ation between T@@ om and the str@@ an@@ ge , ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om .
When I heard that story , it started to shi@@ ft a little bit
the way that I worked too , and this idea already sa@@ ved me once .
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the middle of wr@@ iting &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , L@@ o@@ ve , &quot;
and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of de@@ sp@@ air
that we all f@@ all into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a di@@ sa@@ ster , the wor@@ st book ever wr@@ itten .
Not just bad , but the wor@@ st book ever wr@@ itten .
And I started to think I should just du@@ mp this project .
But then I re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om talking to the open air and I tried it .
So I just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ u@@ script and I direc@@ ted my com@@ ments to an emp@@ ty cor@@ ner of the room .
And I said al@@ oud , &quot; Li@@ sten you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t br@@ illi@@ ant that is not enti@@ rel@@ y my fa@@ ul@@ t , right ?
Because you can see that I am pu@@ tting everything I have into this ,
I don &apos;t have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hel@@ l with it .
I &apos;m going to keep wr@@ iting any@@ way because that &apos;s my job .
And I would p@@ lea@@ se like the recor@@ d to ref@@ lec@@ t today that I sho@@ wed up for my part of the job . &quot;
Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , OK --
centur@@ ies ago in the de@@ ser@@ ts of Nor@@ th Africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and music
that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .
They were always mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , because the d@@ anc@@ ers were profes@@ sion@@ als and they were ter@@ ri@@ fic , right ?
But every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen ,
and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life ,
a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this . It was like time would stop , and the d@@ ancer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al
and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1@@ ,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
And all of a su@@ dden , he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human .
He would be l@@ it from within , and l@@ it from bel@@ ow
and all l@@ it up on fir@@ e with di@@ vin@@ ity .
And when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name . They would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
C@@ ur@@ ious hi@@ stor@@ ical foo@@ t@@ not@@ e : when the M@@ oor@@ s in@@ va@@ ded s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them
and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the centur@@ ies from &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; O@@ l@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot;
which you still hear in b@@ ul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fla@@ men@@ c@@ o dan@@ ces .
In S@@ pa@@ in , when a per@@ form@@ er has done something im@@ possible and ma@@ gic , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , Al@@ la@@ h , mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , bra@@ v@@ o , &quot;
in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sible , there it is -- a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of God .
Wh@@ ich is great , because we need that .
But , the tr@@ ick@@ y bit comes the next morning , for the d@@ ancer hi@@ m@@ self , when he wa@@ kes up and discover@@ s that it &apos;s T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of God .
He &apos;s just an a@@ ging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ ight again .
And maybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant God &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins ,
and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish
if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most ex@@ tra@@ ordinary a@@ spec@@ ts of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just belie@@ ved that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able sour@@ ce for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life
to be pas@@ sed along when you &apos;re fin@@ is@@ hed , with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it star@@ ts to change everything .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think ,
and this is certain@@ ly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will s@@ oon be publi@@ shed ,
as the dan@@ ger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ cip@@ ated fol@@ low up
to my f@@ re@@ ak@@ ish succ@@ ess . And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psych@@ ed out about that is don &apos;t be af@@ ra@@ id .
D@@ on &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted . Just do your job .
C@@ ont@@ in@@ ue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
If your job is to d@@ ance , do your d@@ ance .
If the di@@ v@@ ine , c@@ oc@@ ke@@ yed gen@@ i@@ us as@@ sig@@ ned to your case dec@@ ide@@ s to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be g@@ li@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your ef@@ for@@ ts , then &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot;
And if not , do your d@@ ance any@@ how .
And &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , n@@ on@@ eth@@ el@@ ess .
I believe this and I feel that we must te@@ ach it .
&quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , n@@ on@@ eth@@ el@@ ess , just for having the s@@ he@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep sho@@ wing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ hen : O@@ l@@ é !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projec@@ ts before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean , and discover@@ ing new se@@ ts of gen@@ es .
We &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing biolog@@ y , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that dig@@ ital code into a new p@@ ha@@ se of biolog@@ y with desig@@ ning and syn@@ the@@ si@@ zing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many bi@@ ologi@@ sts have been trying to understand at vari@@ ous le@@ vel@@ s .
We &apos;ve tried vari@@ ous appro@@ ach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents .
We &apos;ve been dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing it now for almost 20 years ;
when we sequ@@ enc@@ ed the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biolog@@ y into the dig@@ ital world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this dig@@ ital universe ? &quot;
This is the map of a small organis@@ m , M@@ y@@ cop@@ la@@ sm@@ a gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the sm@@ alle@@ st gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate in the labor@@ ator@@ y ,
and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ all@@ er gen@@ ome .
We &apos;re able to kno@@ c@@ k out on the order of 100 gen@@ es out of the 500 or so that are here .
When we look at its met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c map , it &apos;s rel@@ ati@@ vely simple comp@@ ared to ours --
tru@@ st me , this is simple --
but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ c@@ k out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ li@@ kel@@ y that this would y@@ i@@ eld a living cell .
So we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ the@@ size this ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to ask some of these most funda@@ mental questions .
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of : can we syn@@ the@@ size a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome ?
Can che@@ mi@@ stry per@@ m@@ it making these really large molecu@@ les where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we boo@@ t up a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome ?
A ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical mater@@ ial .
So , our p@@ ace of dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ ential p@@ ace .
O@@ ur ability to write the gene@@ tic code has been moving pretty s@@ low@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing ,
and our l@@ at@@ est point would put it on , now , an exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ve .
We started this over 15 years ago .
It took sever@@ al sta@@ ges , in fact , starting with a bi@@ oe@@ th@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experi@@ ments .
But it turns out syn@@ the@@ si@@ zing DNA is very difficult .
There are t@@ ens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pie@@ ces of DNA -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in len@@ g@@ th -- and it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
So we had to create a new meth@@ od for pu@@ tting these little pie@@ ces together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the er@@ r@@ ors .
And this was our first at@@ temp@@ t , starting with the dig@@ ital information of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kil@@ ls bacter@@ ia .
We desig@@ ned the pie@@ ces , went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ rec@@ tion
and had a DNA molecu@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ters .
The exc@@ iting p@@ ha@@ se came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical and put it in the bacter@@ ia , and the bacter@@ ia started to read this gene@@ tic code , made the vir@@ al par@@ tic@@ les .
The vir@@ al par@@ tic@@ les then were rel@@ eas@@ ed from the cells and came back and kil@@ led the E@@ . col@@ i .
I was talking to the oil indu@@ stry rec@@ ently and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly under@@ st@@ ood that model .
They la@@ u@@ g@@ hed more than you guys are .
And so , we think this is a situ@@ ation where the software can actually build its own har@@ d@@ ware in a biolog@@ ical system .
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger :
we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ ial ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome --
it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gene@@ tic code --
so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ tes the size of the viru@@ ses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ tes
to understand what the ac@@ tual comp@@ on@@ ents of a living cell are .
De@@ sig@@ n is crit@@ ical , and if you &apos;re starting with dig@@ ital information in the computer , that dig@@ ital information has to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
When we first sequ@@ enc@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 199@@ 5 , the stand@@ ard of ac@@ cur@@ acy was one er@@ ro@@ r per 10@@ ,000 ba@@ se pa@@ ir@@ s .
We actually found , on re@@ sequ@@ enc@@ ing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that origin@@ al sequ@@ ence , it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up .
P@@ art of the design is desig@@ ning pie@@ ces that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ let@@ ter pie@@ ces to build sm@@ all@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
We design uni@@ que ele@@ ments into this .
You may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in .
Th@@ in@@ k of this : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ let@@ ter gene@@ tic code -- A , C , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ ple@@ ts of those let@@ ters code for rou@@ gh@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids , such that there &apos;s a single let@@ ter desig@@ n@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids .
So we can use the gene@@ tic code to write out words , sen@@ ten@@ ces , thou@@ ghts .
In@@ iti@@ ally , all we did was au@@ to@@ grap@@ h it .
Some people were dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted there was not p@@ oe@@ try .
We desig@@ ned these pie@@ ces so we can just che@@ w back with en@@ z@@ y@@ mes ;
there are en@@ z@@ y@@ mes that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them together .
And we started making pie@@ ces , starting with pie@@ ces that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ let@@ ter pie@@ ces , then put se@@ ts of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000 .
At each stage , we gre@@ w up these pie@@ ces in ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extre@@ m@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a minu@@ te .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
So , this looks like a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all pla@@ y@@ off .
When we get into these really large pie@@ ces over 10@@ 0,000 ba@@ se pa@@ ir@@ s , they won &apos;t any longer grow rea@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i --
it ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sts all the moder@@ n tools of mole@@ cular biolog@@ y --
and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ ms .
We knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biolog@@ y us@@ es to re@@ pa@@ ir DNA that can put pie@@ ces together .
Here &apos;s an example of it :
there &apos;s an organis@@ m called De@@ in@@ oc@@ oc@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three mil@@ lions ra@@ ds of radi@@ ation .
You can see in the top pan@@ el , its ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome just gets blo@@ wn ap@@ art .
T@@ wel@@ ve to 2@@ 4 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
We have thousands of organis@@ ms that can do this .
These organis@@ ms can be tot@@ ally de@@ s@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ;
they can live in a v@@ acu@@ um .
I am absolu@@ tely certain that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous environment .
In fact , N@@ A@@ S@@ A has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there .
Here &apos;s an ac@@ tual micro@@ grap@@ h of the molecu@@ le we built using these proc@@ ess@@ es , actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pie@@ ces we put them in ;
ye@@ ast pu@@ ts them together autom@@ at@@ ically .
This is not an electr@@ on micro@@ grap@@ h ; this is just a re@@ gu@@ lar ph@@ ot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ grap@@ h .
It &apos;s such a large molecu@@ le we can see it with a light mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e .
These are pic@@ tures over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second peri@@ od .
So , this is the pub@@ lic@@ ation we had just a short while ago .
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gene@@ tic code ;
it &apos;s the lar@@ ge@@ st molecu@@ le ever made by humans of a defin@@ ed structure .
It &apos;s over 3@@ 00 million mole@@ cular we@@ ight .
If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no sp@@ ac@@ ing , it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 pa@@ ges just to pr@@ int this gene@@ tic code .
Well , how do we boo@@ t up a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome ? How do we acti@@ v@@ ate this ?
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ;
it &apos;s much more comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ aling with bacter@@ ia .
It &apos;s also si@@ m@@ pl@@ er when you go into eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just p@@ op out the nucle@@ us and p@@ op in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ on@@ ing .
W@@ ith bacter@@ ia and Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a , the ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the cell , but we rec@@ ently sho@@ wed that we can do a comple@@ te transp@@ l@@ ant of a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome from one cell to another and acti@@ v@@ ate it .
We pur@@ i@@ f@@ ied a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome from one micro@@ bi@@ al species --
rou@@ gh@@ ly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice --
we ad@@ ded a few extra gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome ,
we di@@ gest@@ ed it with en@@ z@@ y@@ mes to k@@ ill all the prot@@ ein@@ s ,
and it was pretty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate our very s@@ op@@ hi@@ st@@ ic@@ ated graph@@ ics here . The new ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome went into the cell .
In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit fur@@ ther .
This is a maj@@ or mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome or a third one from some@@ where , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
So , people who think of evolution as just one gene chan@@ ging at a time have mis@@ sed much of biolog@@ y .
There are en@@ z@@ y@@ mes called re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion en@@ z@@ y@@ mes that actually di@@ ge@@ st DNA .
The ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ;
the ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome we put in does .
It got ex@@ press@@ ed and it recogni@@ zed the other ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome as for@@ ei@@ g@@ n mater@@ ial , che@@ wed it up , and so we en@@ ded up just with a cell with the new ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome .
It turned bl@@ ue because of the gen@@ es we put in it .
And with a very short peri@@ od of time , all the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of one species were lost and it con@@ ver@@ ted tot@@ ally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the prot@@ ein@@ s changed , the me@@ m@@ br@@ an@@ es changed ; when we read the gene@@ tic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
So , this may sound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dra@@ mat@@ ically .
Now I &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution . And I &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new ver@@ sion of the Cam@@ bri@@ an expl@@ os@@ ion , where there &apos;s mas@@ sive new speci@@ ation based on this dig@@ ital design .
Why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvi@@ ous in terms of some of the needs .
We &apos;re about to go from six and a half to n@@ ine billion people over the next 40 years .
To put it in context for myself : I was bor@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
There are now three people on the planet
for every one of us that ex@@ ist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ e@@ ding , provi@@ ding f@@ res@@ h , cle@@ an water , medic@@ ines , fu@@ el for the six and a half billion .
It &apos;s going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine .
We use over five billion t@@ ons of co@@ al , 30 bil@@ li@@ on-@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of oil --
that &apos;s a hun@@ d@@ red million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
When we try to think of biolog@@ ical proc@@ ess@@ es or any process to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challen@@ ge .
Then of course , there &apos;s all that CO@@ 2 from this mater@@ ial that ends up in the at@@ m@@ osp@@ here .
We now , from our disc@@ o@@ very around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es , and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ents of the future .
The electr@@ on@@ ics indu@@ stry only had a do@@ zen or so comp@@ on@@ ents , and look at the di@@ versity that came out of that .
We &apos;re lim@@ ited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biolog@@ ical real@@ ity and our ima@@ gin@@ ation .
We now have tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , because of these r@@ ap@@ id meth@@ o@@ ds of syn@@ the@@ s@@ is , to do what we &apos;re c@@ all@@ ing combin@@ ator@@ ial gen@@ om@@ ics .
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million ch@@ rom@@ os@@ om@@ es a day .
When you think of proc@@ ess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze proc@@ ess@@ es to produc@@ e oc@@ tan@@ e or to produc@@ e ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , new vacc@@ ines , we can just with a small team , do more mole@@ cular biolog@@ y than the last 20 years of all science .
And it &apos;s just stand@@ ard sel@@ ec@@ tion :
we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chem@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion , vacc@@ ine produc@@ tion , et@@ c .
This is a scre@@ en sn@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to s@@ it down and design species in the computer .
You know , we don &apos;t know nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily what it &apos;ll look like :
we know exactly what their gene@@ tic code looks like .
We &apos;re foc@@ using on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els .
You &apos;ve seen rec@@ ently , cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ o@@ l is just a bad experiment .
We have sec@@ ond@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d-@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els that will be coming out rel@@ ati@@ vely s@@ oon that are su@@ ga@@ r , to much high@@ er@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tan@@ e or different typ@@ es of bu@@ tan@@ o@@ l .
But the only way we think that biolog@@ y can have a maj@@ or impact without fur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its a@@ va@@ il@@ ability is if we start with CO@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ st@@ oc@@ k , and so we &apos;re working with desig@@ ning cells to go down this ro@@ ad . And we think we &apos;ll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
S@@ un@@ light and CO@@ 2 is one meth@@ od ... but in our disc@@ o@@ very around the world , we have all kinds of other meth@@ o@@ ds .
This is an organis@@ m we descri@@ bed in 199@@ 6 .
It lives in the de@@ ep ocean , about a mil@@ e and a half de@@ ep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water temperat@@ ures .
It takes CO@@ 2 to meth@@ an@@ e using mole@@ cular hy@@ dro@@ gen as its energy sour@@ ce .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red CO@@ 2 , which can eas@@ ily be pi@@ ped to sit@@ es , con@@ ver@@ t that CO@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to dri@@ ve this process .
So , in a short peri@@ od of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the ba@@ sic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot;
We tru@@ ly , you know , have mo@@ de@@ st go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l-@@ chem@@ ical indu@@ stry --
Yeah . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? --
become a maj@@ or sour@@ ce of energy ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant se@@ ts of vacc@@ ines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with fl@@ u ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vacc@@ ine .
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ ator@@ ial vacc@@ ines in ad@@ van@@ ce .
Here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with chan@@ ging , now , the evolu@@ tion@@ ary tre@@ e , spe@@ e@@ ding up evolution with syn@@ the@@ tic bacter@@ ia , Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and , even@@ tually , eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
We &apos;re a ways away from im@@ pro@@ ving people :
our go@@ al is just to make sure that we have a chan@@ ce to survi@@ ve long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some f@@ ound@@ ational work , some new technology that we brought to M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t as part of an ac@@ qu@@ is@@ ition almost exactly a year ago .
This is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either loc@@ ally or re@@ mot@@ ely inter@@ act with vast am@@ oun@@ ts of visu@@ al data .
We &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of dig@@ ital photo@@ s here and kind of se@@ am@@ le@@ ss@@ ly and contin@@ u@@ ously z@@ oo@@ ming in , pan@@ ning through it , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the ima@@ ges are .
M@@ ost of them are ordinary dig@@ ital camera photo@@ s , but this one , for example , is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s in the 3@@ 00 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el ran@@ ge .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your scre@@ en at any given moment .
It &apos;s also very fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble architec@@ ture .
This is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
This is &quot; B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ou@@ se &quot; by D@@ ick@@ ens . E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter .
To pro@@ ve to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real represen@@ tation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
Ma@@ ybe this is an arti@@ fic@@ ial way to read an e-@@ book .
I wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
This is a more real@@ ist@@ ic case , an issu@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
E@@ very large image is the beginning of a sec@@ tion .
And this really gives you the jo@@ y and the good experience of rea@@ ding the real paper ver@@ sion of a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , which is an in@@ her@@ ently mul@@ ti@@ -@@ scale kind of medi@@ um .
We &apos;ve done something with the cor@@ ner of this particular issu@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
We &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high re@@ solution -- much high@@ er than in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra cont@@ ent .
If you want to see the fe@@ at@@ ures of this car , you can see it here .
Or other model@@ s , or even tech@@ n@@ ical speci@@ fic@@ ations .
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on scre@@ en real est@@ ate .
We hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish like that -- sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be nec@@ ess@@ ary .
Of course , m@@ app@@ ing is one of those obvi@@ ous app@@ lic@@ ations for a technology like this . And this one I really won &apos;t spend any time on , ex@@ cept to say that we have things to cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ te to this field as well .
But those are all the ro@@ ads in the U.S.
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ os@@ pati@@ al image .
So let &apos;s pul@@ l up , now , something else .
This is actually live on the We@@ b now ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it out .
This is a project called Ph@@ ot@@ osy@@ n@@ th , which mar@@ r@@ ies two different technologies .
One of them is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful compu@@ ter@@ -@@ vi@@ sion research done by No@@ ah S@@ na@@ vely , a gra@@ du@@ ate student at the Uni@@ versity of W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton , co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by Ste@@ ve Se@@ it@@ z at U.@@ W@@ .
and R@@ ick S@@ zel@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t Re@@ search . A very nice col@@ labor@@ ation .
And so this is live on the We@@ b . It &apos;s power@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through ima@@ ges and have this kind of mul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ solution experience .
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment of the ima@@ ges here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful .
The computer vi@@ sion al@@ gor@@ i@@ th@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these ima@@ ges together so that they cor@@ resp@@ ond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken ne@@ ar G@@ ra@@ ss@@ i La@@ kes in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . So you see ele@@ ments here of st@@ ab@@ ili@@ zed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environ@@ ments .
Some are much more sp@@ ati@@ al .
I would like to ju@@ mp stra@@ ight to one of No@@ ah &apos;s origin@@ al dat@@ a@@ -@@ se@@ ts -- this is from an early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e that we first got working this su@@ mmer -- to show you what I think is really the pun@@ ch line behind the Ph@@ ot@@ osy@@ n@@ th technology , It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environ@@ ments we &apos;ve put up on the website .
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on .
This is a re@@ construc@@ tion of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done enti@@ rel@@ y compu@@ t@@ ation@@ ally from ima@@ ges sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ed from F@@ lic@@ k@@ r . You just type N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , and you get some pic@@ tures of guys in T@@ -@@ shi@@ r@@ ts , and of the cam@@ p@@ us and so on .
And each of these or@@ an@@ ge con@@ es represen@@ ts an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
And so these are all F@@ lic@@ k@@ r ima@@ ges , and they &apos;ve all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way .
We can just na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t .
It &apos;s very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here .
I gu@@ ess you can see this is lots of different typ@@ es of cam@@ er@@ as : it &apos;s everything from cel@@ l-@@ phone cam@@ er@@ as to profes@@ sion@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s , quite a large number of them , st@@ it@@ ched together in this environment .
If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ird ones --
So many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by fac@@ es , and so on .
S@@ ome@@ where in here there is actually a ser@@ ies of photograp@@ h@@ s -- here we go .
This is actually a po@@ ster of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame that regi@@ ster@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
We can di@@ ve in from the po@@ ster to a phys@@ ical view of this environment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive me@@ mor@@ y , visu@@ ally , of what the Earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together .
Th@@ ose photo@@ s become lin@@ ked , and they make something emer@@ gen@@ t that &apos;s gre@@ ater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire Earth .
Th@@ in@@ k of this as the long ta@@ il to Ste@@ ph@@ en La@@ w@@ ler &apos;s V@@ ir@@ tual Earth work .
And this is something that gro@@ ws in complex@@ ity as people use it , and wh@@ ose ben@@ ef@@ its become gre@@ ater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
The@@ ir own photo@@ s are getting ta@@ g@@ ged with me@@ ta@@ -@@ data that somebody else en@@ ter@@ ed .
If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my p@@ ho@@ to of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al su@@ d@@ den@@ ly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that data , and I can use it as an en@@ try point to di@@ ve into that space , into that me@@ ta@@ -@@ ver@@ se , using everybody else &apos;s photo@@ s , and do a kind of a cr@@ os@@ s-@@ mo@@ d@@ al and cr@@ os@@ s-@@ us@@ er social experience that way .
And of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ mensel@@ y r@@ ich vir@@ tual model@@ s of every interesting part of the Earth , collec@@ ted not just from over@@ head f@@ li@@ ghts and from s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ e ima@@ ges and so on , but from the collec@@ tive me@@ mor@@ y .
Thank you so much .
Chris An@@ der@@ son : Do I understand this right ? What your software is going to al@@ low , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pic@@ tures that are sh@@ ared by any@@ one across the world are going to lin@@ k together ?
B@@ A@@ A : Yes . What this is really doing is discover@@ ing ,
cre@@ ating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between ima@@ ges .
It &apos;s doing that based on the cont@@ ent inside the ima@@ ges .
And that gets really exc@@ iting when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information a lot of ima@@ ges have .
Li@@ ke when you do a web search for ima@@ ges , you type in ph@@ ra@@ ses , and the text on the web pa@@ ge is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of information
about what that picture is of .
What if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tures ? The amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connec@@ tion and ri@@ ch@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . It &apos;s a cla@@ s@@ sic net@@ work effect .
CA : T@@ ru@@ ly incredible . Con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
You know , one of the inten@@ se ple@@ as@@ ures of tra@@ vel and one of the del@@ igh@@ ts of eth@@ no@@ grap@@ hi@@ c research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones po@@ li@@ shed by ra@@ in , ta@@ ste it in the bit@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts .
Just to know that J@@ a@@ gu@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still jour@@ ney be@@ y@@ ond the Mil@@ ky W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ uit el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with mean@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ a , the Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ y , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absolu@@ te sense , but is just one model of real@@ ity ,
the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it succ@@ ess@@ ful@@ ly , many gener@@ ations ago .
And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves . We &apos;re all bor@@ n . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation rit@@ es .
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of death ,
so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t surpri@@ se us that we all sing , we all d@@ ance , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ que ca@@ dence of the s@@ ong , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every culture .
And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Ha@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut de@@ ser@@ t of Nor@@ ther@@ n Ken@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ a@@ van@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the middle of the Sa@@ har@@ a -- this is in@@ ci@@ den@@ t@@ ally the f@@ el@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the de@@ ser@@ t with a m@@ ont@@ h ago -- or in@@ deed a y@@ a@@ k her@@ der in the sl@@ op@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma ,
E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss mother of the world .
All of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of or@@ i@@ en@@ ting yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hope .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a web of spir@@ itu@@ al life and cultur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the wel@@ l-@@ being of the planet as in@@ deed is the biolog@@ ical web of life that you know as a bi@@ osp@@ here .
And you might think of this cultur@@ al web of life as being an eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here ,
and you might de@@ f@@ ine the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here as being the sum tot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ ams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ons brought into being by the human ima@@ gin@@ ation since the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss .
The eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here is human@@ ity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
It &apos;s the sym@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive species .
And just as the bi@@ osp@@ here has been sever@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here -- and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater r@@ ate .
No bi@@ ologi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are sugge@@ st that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it simply is not true ,
and yet that -- the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o sc@@ ar@@ cel@@ y appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cultur@@ al di@@ versity .
And the great in@@ dic@@ ator of that , of course , is language los@@ s .
When each of you in this room were bor@@ n , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ a@@ ges sp@@ o@@ ken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ mat@@ ical ru@@ les .
A language is a fla@@ sh of the human spir@@ it .
It &apos;s a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the mater@@ ial world .
E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th for@@ est of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ec@@ osy@@ stem of spir@@ itu@@ al pos@@ sibil@@ ities .
And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ a@@ ges , as we s@@ it here today in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , ful@@ ly half are no longer being wh@@ i@@ sp@@ er@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
They &apos;re no longer being t@@ au@@ ght to bab@@ ies ,
which means , effec@@ ti@@ vely , un@@ less something changes , they &apos;re already de@@ ad .
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in s@@ il@@ ence , to be the last of your people to spea@@ k your language , to have no way to pas@@ s on the wis@@ dom of the anc@@ est@@ ors or anti@@ cip@@ ate the prom@@ ise of the children ?
And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ deed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ r@@ ies with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ la@@ b@@ les of an anci@@ ent ton@@ gu@@ e .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one language ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ ub@@ a . Let &apos;s make it C@@ an@@ ton@@ ese .
Let &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot; And you &apos;ll su@@ d@@ den@@ ly disc@@ over what it would be like to be un@@ able to spea@@ k your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , a br@@ ief jour@@ ney through the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Ta@@ ke , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ma@@ zon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the ea@@ st in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ na@@ kes .
Now , this is a people who c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ vely do not dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish the col@@ or bl@@ ue from the col@@ or green because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people de@@ p@@ end .
They have a cur@@ ious language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; l@@ ing@@ u@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
And this is all roo@@ ted in the my@@ th@@ olog@@ ical past , yet the cur@@ ious thing is in these long hou@@ ses , where there are six or seven langu@@ a@@ ges sp@@ o@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear any@@ one pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a language .
They simply li@@ sten and then begin to spea@@ k .
Or , one of the most fascin@@ ating tri@@ bes I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8 .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies at@@ temp@@ ted contact and made a crit@@ ical mi@@ sta@@ ke .
They dro@@ pp@@ ed from the air 8 x 10 g@@ los@@ s@@ y photograp@@ h@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly ge@@ stu@@ res , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never seen anything tw@@ o-@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al in their lives .
They pic@@ ked up these photograp@@ h@@ s from the for@@ est fl@@ oor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure ,
found nothing , and con@@ clu@@ ded that these were c@@ all@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to death .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders . They spe@@ ared each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ aring each other .
We trac@@ ed gene@@ al@@ og@@ ies back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stan@@ ces of natural death
and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him any@@ way . But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ ious knowledge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing .
The@@ ir hun@@ ters could sm@@ ell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at Har@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to Ha@@ it@@ i , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ r@@ et soc@@ ie@@ ties which were the f@@ ound@@ ation of D@@ u@@ val@@ ier &apos;s str@@ en@@ g@@ th and T@@ ont@@ on M@@ ac@@ ou@@ tes , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ b@@ ies .
In order to make sense out of sen@@ s@@ ation , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ ith of V@@ o@@ d@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black ma@@ gic cul@@ t .
O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex met@@ ap@@ h@@ ys@@ ical wor@@ l@@ d@@ view . It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , I@@ sla@@ m , Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ism , Ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa had no religi@@ ous belie@@ fs . Well , of course , they did
and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic Di@@ a@@ sp@@ or@@ a of the sla@@ very era .
But , what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad .
So , the living give bir@@ th to the spir@@ its .
The spir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from bene@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ en@@ tar@@ ily disp@@ l@@ ace the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that br@@ ief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the V@@ ood@@ oo@@ ists like to say that &quot; You white people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spea@@ k about God .
We d@@ ance in the temp@@ le and become God . &quot; And because you are pos@@ se@@ ss@@ ed , you are taken by the spir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ m@@ ed ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ations : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ b@@ ers with im@@ pun@@ ity ,
a rather ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ zed in the state of extre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most ex@@ tra@@ ordinary are the K@@ og@@ i of the Si@@ er@@ ra Ne@@ v@@ ad@@ a de S@@ an@@ ta Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a .
De@@ sc@@ en@@ dan@@ ts of the anci@@ ent T@@ air@@ on@@ a civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation which once car@@ pe@@ ted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ qu@@ est ,
these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that s@@ o@@ ars ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
In a bl@@ ood@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the S@@ pan@@ ish .
To this day , they re@@ ma@@ in ru@@ led by a r@@ itu@@ al pr@@ ie@@ s@@ th@@ ood but the tra@@ ining for the pr@@ ie@@ s@@ th@@ ood is rather ex@@ tra@@ ordinary .
The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their famil@@ ies at the age of three and four ,
se@@ quest@@ er@@ ed in a sha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the ba@@ se of g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 18 years :
two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ o@@ ds del@@ i@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s w@@ om@@ b ;
now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the w@@ om@@ b of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are in@@ cultur@@ ated into the valu@@ es of their society , valu@@ es that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ pos@@ ition that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ tain the c@@ os@@ mic -- or we might say the ec@@ olog@@ ical -- bal@@ ance .
And at the end of this amazing in@@ iti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re su@@ d@@ den@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a s@@ un@@ ri@@ se . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un begin@@ s to ba@@ the the sl@@ op@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ingly beautiful land@@ sc@@ ape , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning g@@ l@@ or@@ y . And the pr@@ ie@@ st ste@@ ps back
and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prot@@ ect . &quot; They call themselves the &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot;
and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones respon@@ sible for de@@ stro@@ ying the world .
Now , this level of in@@ tu@@ ition be@@ comes very important .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ sc@@ ape , we either in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ va@@ ge , &quot; which is an idea r@@ ac@@ ist in its simp@@ lic@@ ity ,
or al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ vely , we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ or@@ ea@@ u and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are .
Well , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ mental no@@ r we@@ a@@ ken@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ wa@@ mp@@ s of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ b@@ et , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , through time and r@@ itu@@ al , for@@ ged a tradi@@ tional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ con@@ sci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ ition : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss .
Now , what does that mean ? It means that a young k@@ id from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ tain is an A@@ p@@ u spir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her de@@ st@@ in@@ y will be a prof@@ ound@@ ly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that resour@@ ce or that place than a young k@@ id from M@@ ont@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ tain is a p@@ ile of roc@@ k ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ ode of a spir@@ it or a p@@ ile of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ est@@ s of Brit@@ ish Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ est@@ s ex@@ ist@@ ed to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ est@@ s were the ab@@ ode of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ roo@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of H@@ ea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the nor@@ th end of the world ,
spir@@ its they would have to en@@ ga@@ ge during their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a in@@ iti@@ ation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different real@@ ities , you could begin to understand some of their ex@@ tra@@ ordinary discover@@ ies . Ta@@ ke this pl@@ ant here .
It &apos;s a photograp@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ma@@ zon just last A@@ pri@@ l .
This is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ acti@@ ve pre@@ par@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
What makes a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a fascin@@ ating is not the s@@ he@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ olog@@ ical pot@@ ential of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sour@@ ces :
on the one hand , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a ser@@ ies of be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ m@@ ine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is rather to have sort of bl@@ ue ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your con@@ sci@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss --
but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e family called P@@ sych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
This pl@@ ant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ meth@@ ox@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins meth@@ ox@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
To have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pa@@ in@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electr@@ ic@@ ity . It doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of real@@ ity ; it cre@@ ates the di@@ ss@@ ol@@ u@@ tion of real@@ ity .
In fact , I used to argu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or , Richard E@@ van S@@ hul@@ tes -- who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ che@@ del@@ ic era with his disc@@ o@@ very of the ma@@ gic mu@@ sh@@ roo@@ ms in M@@ ex@@ ico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s --
I used to argu@@ e that you couldn &apos;t cla@@ s@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effec@@ ts there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation . But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ i@@ da@@ se .
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other chem@@ ical that den@@ at@@ ures the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the fascin@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ ci@@ se sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine . So you ask yourself a question . How , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cular plan@@ ts , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated plan@@ ts that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bi@@ o@@ chem@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ ater than the sum of the parts ?
Well , we use that great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ less .
But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; The plan@@ ts talk to us . &quot; Well , what does that mean ? This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 var@@ ie@@ ties of a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a , all of which they dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish a great dist@@ ance in the for@@ est , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one species .
And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ lish their ta@@ x@@ onom@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you knew something about plan@@ ts .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 var@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full m@@ oon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at Har@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting sta@@ mens .
Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ a@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how reduc@@ ed to the mar@@ gin@@ s of history as the real world , mean@@ ing our world , mo@@ ves on .
Well , the tru@@ th is the 20@@ th century , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed for its w@@ ars or its technolog@@ ical innov@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we st@@ ood by and either acti@@ vely en@@ dor@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vely ac@@ cep@@ ted the mas@@ sive de@@ struc@@ tion of both biolog@@ ical and cultur@@ al di@@ versity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ stan@@ tly been en@@ ga@@ ged in a d@@ ance with new pos@@ sibil@@ ities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an American stop@@ ped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that th@@ re@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ity of the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here . It is power ,
the cru@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation .
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you disc@@ over that these are not cul@@ tures de@@ st@@ ined to fa@@ de away ;
these are dynam@@ ic living pe@@ op@@ les being dri@@ ven out of ex@@ ist@@ ence by iden@@ ti@@ fi@@ able for@@ ces that are be@@ y@@ ond their cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to :
whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an -- a people who li@@ ved free in the for@@ est until a gener@@ ation ago , and now have all been reduc@@ ed to serv@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the ri@@ ver itself is s@@ o@@ i@@ led with the s@@ il@@ t that seem@@ s to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the S@@ outh China Se@@ a , where the Jap@@ an@@ ese f@@ re@@ igh@@ ters han@@ g light in the hor@@ iz@@ on
ready to f@@ ill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w log@@ s ri@@ pp@@ ed from the for@@ est --
or , in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami , it &apos;s the disease en@@ tit@@ ies that have come in , in the wa@@ ke of the disc@@ o@@ very of g@@ old .
Or if we go into the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of T@@ i@@ b@@ et , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research rec@@ ently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of polit@@ ical dom@@ in@@ ation .
You know , gen@@ oc@@ ide , the phys@@ ical ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the de@@ struc@@ tion of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ned , it &apos;s univers@@ ally , in many qu@@ ar@@ ters , cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated as part of a develop@@ ment strateg@@ y .
And you cannot understand the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ b@@ et until you move through it at the ground level .
I once tra@@ vel@@ led 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ en@@ g@@ d@@ u in West@@ er@@ n China over@@ land through s@@ ou@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n T@@ i@@ b@@ et to L@@ ha@@ s@@ a
with a young col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e , and it was only when I got to L@@ ha@@ s@@ a that I under@@ st@@ ood the face behind the statist@@ ics you hear about :
6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ments tor@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and as@@ he@@ s , 1@@ .@@ 2 million people kil@@ led by the c@@ ad@@ res during the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ evolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ c@@ ri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ ama .
That me@@ ant he was in@@ stan@@ tly kil@@ led at the time of the Chinese in@@ va@@ sion .
H@@ is un@@ cle f@@ led with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness in the Di@@ a@@ sp@@ or@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al .
H@@ is mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the c@@ ri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ thy .
He was s@@ mu@@ g@@ g@@ led into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be without him .
The si@@ ster who had done that bra@@ ve deed was put into an education cam@@ p .
One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ mb@@ and of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gre@@ s@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard la@@ b@@ or .
The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ b@@ et can be im@@ possible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spir@@ it of the people is something to beh@@ old .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a cho@@ ice :
do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ rom@@ ati@@ c world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ rom@@ ati@@ c world of di@@ versity ?
Mar@@ gar@@ et Me@@ ad , the great an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ st , said , before she died , that her gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted to@@ wards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ p@@ hou@@ s gener@@ ic world view
not only would we see the entire ran@@ ge of the human ima@@ gin@@ ation reduc@@ ed to a more n@@ ar@@ row mo@@ d@@ ality of thought , but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day having for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten there were even other pos@@ sibil@@ ities .
And it &apos;s hu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolution -- which gave us a@@ gr@@ icul@@ ture , at which time we suc@@ cu@@ m@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the p@@ oe@@ try of the sha@@ man was disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pr@@ ie@@ s@@ th@@ ood ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ al@@ ization sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10@@ ,000 years ago .
The moder@@ n industri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 3@@ 00 years old .
Now , that sh@@ al@@ low history doesn &apos;t sugge@@ st to me that we have all the ans@@ wers for all of the challen@@ ges that will conf@@ ron@@ t us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ len@@ ni@@ a .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world are asked the mean@@ ing of being human , they resp@@ ond with 10@@ ,000 different vo@@ ices .
And it &apos;s within that s@@ ong that we will all re@@ disc@@ over the pos@@ sibility of being what we are : a ful@@ ly con@@ sci@@ ous species , ful@@ ly a@@ ware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh . And there are great mom@@ ents of op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
This is a photograp@@ h I took at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Is@@ land when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some In@@ uit people ,
and this man , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his gr@@ and@@ father .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ uit people , and during the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , to est@@ ab@@ lish our s@@ over@@ ei@@ g@@ n@@ ty , we for@@ ced them into se@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ ments .
This old man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ father ref@@ used to go .
The family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his we@@ ap@@ ons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the In@@ uit did not fe@@ ar the c@@ old ; they took ad@@ van@@ tage of it .
The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wr@@ app@@ ed in c@@ ari@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de .
So , this man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ father was not in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
He simply sli@@ pp@@ ed outside , pul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . And as the f@@ ec@@ es began to f@@ ree@@ ze , he sh@@ ap@@ ed it into the form of a bla@@ de .
He put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe
and as it finally fro@@ ze s@@ oli@@ d , he bu@@ t@@ ch@@ er@@ ed a do@@ g with it .
He s@@ kin@@ ned the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness ,
took the ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge of the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a sle@@ d ,
har@@ ne@@ ss@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g , and dis@@ appe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in bel@@ t .
Talk about getting by with nothing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a sym@@ bo@@ l of the resi@@ li@@ ence of the In@@ uit people and of all in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government in A@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to tot@@ al control of the In@@ uit an area of land lar@@ ger than Californi@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put together . It &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an in@@ depen@@ dent ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y . They control all min@@ er@@ al resour@@ ces .
A@@ n amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek re@@ stitu@@ tion with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous at least to all of all us who &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed in these re@@ mot@@ e re@@ ach@@ es of the planet , to re@@ alize that they &apos;re not re@@ mot@@ e at all .
They &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
They re@@ present br@@ an@@ ches of the human ima@@ gin@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of time . And for all of us , the dre@@ ams of these children , like the dre@@ ams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked ge@@ o@@ graph@@ y of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the N@@ ational Ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c , finally , is , we believe that polit@@ ici@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ lish anything .
We think that po@@ le@@ m@@ ics -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ m@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ a@@ sive , but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling institu@@ tion in the world . We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our website every m@@ ont@@ h . 1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our tel@@ evi@@ sion chan@@ ne@@ l . O@@ ur ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines are read by mil@@ lions .
And what we &apos;re doing is a ser@@ ies of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here where we &apos;re going to take our audi@@ ence to places of such cultur@@ al w@@ onder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , ther@@ ef@@ ore , em@@ br@@ ace gra@@ du@@ ally , one by one , the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ y : that this world de@@ ser@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ ver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a tru@@ ly mul@@ ti@@ cultur@@ al , pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic world
where all of the wis@@ dom of all pe@@ op@@ les can cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ te to our collec@@ tive wel@@ l-@@ being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of m@@ ine
that I hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard ,
and I &apos;ll try to make some connec@@ tions myself , in case you mis@@ sed them .
But I want to start with what I call the &quot; off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
The off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma of what ? The off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma of all West@@ er@@ n industri@@ al soc@@ ie@@ ties .
And the off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma run@@ s like this : if we are interested in ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ ing the wel@@ f@@ are of our cit@@ iz@@ ens , the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze individu@@ al f@@ ree@@ dom .
The reason for this is both that f@@ ree@@ dom is in and of itself good , valu@@ able , wor@@ th@@ while , essenti@@ al to being human .
And because if people have f@@ ree@@ dom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to deci@@ de on our be@@ half .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze f@@ ree@@ dom is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze cho@@ ice .
The more cho@@ ice people have , the more f@@ ree@@ dom they have ,
and the more f@@ ree@@ dom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded in the water su@@ pp@@ ly that it wouldn &apos;t oc@@ c@@ ur to any@@ one to question it .
And it &apos;s also de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some exam@@ p@@ les of what moder@@ n pro@@ gre@@ ss has made possible for us .
This is my super@@ market .
Not such a big one . I want to say just a word about s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing .
1@@ 7@@ 5 s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t coun@@ t the 10 ex@@ tra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sa@@ mic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy
to make a very large number of your own s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chan@@ ce that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the stor@@ e has on off@@ er su@@ it you .
So this is what the super@@ market is like .
And then you go to the consu@@ mer electr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spea@@ kers , C@@ D pla@@ y@@ er , t@@ ape pla@@ y@@ er , tun@@ er , am@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ier --
and in this one single consu@@ mer electr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o systems .
We can construc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o systems out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one stor@@ e .
You &apos;ve got to ad@@ m@@ it that &apos;s a lot of cho@@ ice .
In other dom@@ a@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations .
There was a time , when I was a bo@@ y , when you could get any kind of tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one serv@@ ice you wanted , as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell .
You ren@@ ted your phone . You didn &apos;t buy it .
One con@@ sequ@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the phone never bro@@ ke .
And those days are gone .
We now have an almost un@@ lim@@ ited var@@ iety of ph@@ ones ,
e@@ speci@@ ally in the world of cell ph@@ ones .
These are cell ph@@ ones of the future .
My favor@@ ite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 pla@@ y@@ er , n@@ ose ha@@ ir tri@@ mmer , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch .
And if by some chan@@ ce you haven &apos;t seen that in your stor@@ e yet , you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day s@@ oon , you will .
And what this does is it lea@@ ds people to walk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this question .
And do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
The answer is &quot; no . &quot;
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other a@@ spec@@ ts of life that are much more sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same expl@@ os@@ ion of cho@@ ice is true .
He@@ al@@ th care . It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doc@@ tor , and the doc@@ tor tel@@ ls you what to do .
In@@ ste@@ ad , you go to the doc@@ tor , and the doc@@ tor tel@@ ls you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B@@ .
A has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks .
B has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Do@@ c , what should I do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; A has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks , and B has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were me , Do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And the resul@@ t is -- we call it &quot; pati@@ ent au@@ t@@ onom@@ y , &quot;
which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the respon@@ sibility for deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doc@@ tor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certain@@ ly s@@ ick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making deci@@ sions -- nam@@ ely , the pati@@ ent . There &apos;s enor@@ m@@ ous marke@@ ting of pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion dru@@ gs
to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
Why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
The answer is that they exp@@ ect us to call our doc@@ tors the next morning and ask for our pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
S@@ ome@@ thing as dra@@ mati@@ c as our iden@@ t@@ ity has now become a matter of cho@@ ice , as this sli@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate .
We don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an iden@@ t@@ ity ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
And that means that every day , when you wa@@ ke up in the morning , you have to deci@@ de what kind of person you want to be .
W@@ ith resp@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and family ,
there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that almost everyone had is that you got mar@@ r@@ ied as s@@ oon as you could , and then you started having kids as s@@ oon as you could .
The only real cho@@ ice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
No@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for gra@@ bs .
I te@@ ach wonder@@ ful@@ ly intelligen@@ t students , and I as@@ sig@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less s@@ mar@@ t , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ ligen@@ t .
It &apos;s because they are pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ied , as@@ king themselves ,
&quot; S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ r@@ ied or not ? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ r@@ ied now ? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ r@@ ied later ?
S@@ h@@ ould I have kids first , or a car@@ eer first ? &quot;
All of these are consu@@ ming questions .
And they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I as@@ sig@@ n and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ ses .
And in@@ deed they should . These are important questions to answer .
Wor@@ k -- we are ble@@ ss@@ ed , as Car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every minu@@ te of every day from any place on the planet -- ex@@ cept the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el .
There is one cor@@ ner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the W@@ i@@ F@@ i actually works .
I &apos;m not telling you about it because I want to use it .
So what this means , this incredible f@@ ree@@ dom of cho@@ ice we have with resp@@ ect to work , is that we have to make a deci@@ sion , again and again and again , about whether we should or sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be working .
We can go to wat@@ ch our k@@ id play soc@@ c@@ er , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our lap@@ top , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly , on our l@@ aps .
And even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every minu@@ te that we &apos;re wat@@ ching our k@@ id mu@@ t@@ il@@ ate a soc@@ c@@ er game , we are also as@@ king ourselves , &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I answer this cell phone call ?
S@@ h@@ ould I resp@@ ond to this e@@ ma@@ il ? S@@ h@@ ould I dra@@ ft this let@@ ter ? &quot;
And even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certain@@ ly going to make the experience of your k@@ id &apos;s soc@@ c@@ er game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
So every@@ where we look , big things and small things , mater@@ ial things and li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le things , life is a matter of cho@@ ice .
And the world we used to live in looked like this .
&#91; Well , actually , they are wr@@ itten in st@@ one . &#93; That is to say , there were some cho@@ ices , but not everything was a matter of cho@@ ice .
And the world we now live in looks like this . &#91; The Ten Com@@ m@@ and@@ ments D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it &#93;
And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
And the answer is , &quot; y@@ es . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
All of this cho@@ ice has two effec@@ ts , two neg@@ ative effec@@ ts on people .
One effect , para@@ do@@ x@@ ically , is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , rather than li@@ ber@@ ation .
W@@ ith so many op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from , people find it very difficult to cho@@ ose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ mati@@ c example of this : a study that was done of inve@@ st@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment plan@@ s .
A col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e of m@@ ine got acc@@ ess to inve@@ st@@ ment recor@@ ds from V@@ an@@ gu@@ ard , the gi@@ gan@@ tic mu@@ tu@@ al@@ -@@ fu@@ nd company of about a million emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ places .
And what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er off@@ er@@ ed , r@@ ate of parti@@ cip@@ ation went down two percent .
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ wer emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es parti@@ cip@@ ate than if you only off@@ er five . Why ?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to cho@@ ose from , it &apos;s so da@@ m@@ n hard to deci@@ de which fu@@ nd to cho@@ ose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tom@@ or@@ row . And then tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row ,
and of course tom@@ or@@ row never comes .
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat do@@ g food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the deci@@ sion is so hard that they pas@@ s up sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er .
B@@ y not parti@@ cip@@ ating , they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollars a year
from the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er , who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion .
So par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ices . And I think it makes the world look like this .
&#91; And la@@ st@@ ly , for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , F@@ ren@@ ch , ble@@ u che@@ ese , or ran@@ ch ? &#93;
You really want to get the deci@@ sion right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pic@@ k the wrong mu@@ tual fu@@ nd , or the wrong s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing .
So that &apos;s one effect . The second effect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and make a cho@@ ice , we end up less s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied with the resul@@ t of the cho@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from .
And there are sever@@ al reas@@ ons for this .
One of them is that with a lot of different s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings to cho@@ ose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing is ? --
it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have made a different cho@@ ice that would have been better .
And what happens is this ima@@ gin@@ ed al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gr@@ et the deci@@ sion you made ,
and this re@@ gr@@ et sub@@ trac@@ ts from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the deci@@ sion you made , even if it was a good deci@@ sion .
The more op@@ tions there are , the ea@@ si@@ er it is to re@@ gr@@ et anything at all that is dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ ose .
S@@ ec@@ ond , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity co@@ sts . &quot;
Dan G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to .
Well , when there are lots of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves to consi@@ der , it is easy to imagine the at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ve fe@@ at@@ ures of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ ject
that make you less s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied with the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative that you &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en .
Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t stop thinking about those other a@@ va@@ il@@ able par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et &#93; S@@ or@@ ry if you &apos;re not New Yor@@ kers .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re sup@@ posed to be thinking .
Here &apos;s this couple on the H@@ am@@ p@@ t@@ ons .
Ver@@ y exp@@ en@@ sive real est@@ ate .
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach . Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful day . They have it all to themselves .
What could be better ? &quot; Well , da@@ m@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking ,
&quot; It &apos;s Au@@ g@@ ust . E@@ very@@ body in my M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood is away .
I could be par@@ king right in front of my building . &quot;
And he sp@@ ends two weeks na@@ g@@ ged by the idea that he is mis@@ sing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
O@@ p@@ portun@@ ity co@@ sts sub@@ tr@@ act from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we cho@@ ose , even when what we cho@@ ose is ter@@ ri@@ fic .
And the more op@@ tions there are to consi@@ der , the more at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ve fe@@ at@@ ures of these op@@ tions
are going to be ref@@ lec@@ ted by us as opportunity co@@ sts .
Here &apos;s another example .
Now this car@@ t@@ oon makes a lot of poin@@ ts .
It makes poin@@ ts about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things s@@ low@@ ly .
But one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things
that may have lots of at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ve fe@@ at@@ ures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ve .
Th@@ ird : esc@@ al@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans .
I we@@ ar je@@ ans almost all the time .
There was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ v@@ or , and you b@@ ought them , and they f@@ it like cra@@ p , they were incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ for@@ table , if you wor@@ e them and wa@@ shed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years of we@@ aring these old ones ,
and I said , &quot; I want a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans . Here &apos;s my size . &quot;
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said , &quot; Do you want sli@@ m f@@ it , easy f@@ it , rel@@ a@@ x@@ ed f@@ it ?
You want bu@@ t@@ ton fly or zi@@ p@@ per fly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ wa@@ shed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ wa@@ shed ?
Do you want them di@@ stre@@ ss@@ ed ?
You want boo@@ t cut , t@@ ap@@ er@@ ed , bla@@ h bla@@ h . &quot; O@@ n and on he went .
My ja@@ w dro@@ pp@@ ed . And after I rec@@ over@@ ed , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
He had no idea what that was , so I spent an h@@ our trying on all these da@@ m@@ n je@@ ans ,
and I wal@@ ked out of the stor@@ e -- tru@@ th ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ f@@ it@@ ting je@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . All this cho@@ ice made it possible for me to do better .
But -- I f@@ elt wor@@ se .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to try to expla@@ in this to myself .
The reason -- The reason I f@@ elt wor@@ se is that , with all of these op@@ tions a@@ va@@ il@@ able , my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about how good a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low , no particular exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one fla@@ v@@ or .
When they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s , da@@ m@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
And what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
And so I comp@@ ared what I got to what I exp@@ ected , and what I got was dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting in comp@@ ar@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ected .
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
And what that &apos;s going to produc@@ e is less s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion with resul@@ ts , even when they &apos;re good resul@@ ts .
No@@ body in the world of marke@@ ting knows this .
&#91; It all looks so great . I can &apos;t wa@@ it to be dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted . &#93; Because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
The tru@@ th is more like this .
&#91; E@@ very@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se &#93;
The reason that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se , it was actually possible for people to have experi@@ ences that were a ple@@ as@@ ant surpri@@ se .
No@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ al@@ ized cit@@ iz@@ ens , with perf@@ ec@@ tion the exp@@ ec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you exp@@ ect it to be .
You will never be ple@@ as@@ an@@ tly surpri@@ sed because your exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations , my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations ,
have gone through the roo@@ f . The sec@@ r@@ et to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the sec@@ r@@ et to happiness is low exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
&#91; You &apos;ll do &#93; I want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bi@@ o@@ graph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am mar@@ r@@ ied to a wi@@ fe , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
I couldn &apos;t have done better .
I didn &apos;t se@@ t@@ tle .
But se@@ t@@ t@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing . F@@ in@@ ally -- One con@@ sequ@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are di@@ ss@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied , and you ask why ,
who &apos;s respon@@ sible ,
the answer is clear : the world is respon@@ sible . What could you do ?
When there are hun@@ dre@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of je@@ ans a@@ va@@ il@@ able , and you buy one that is dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s respon@@ sible ?
It is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
You could have done better .
W@@ ith a hun@@ d@@ red different kinds of je@@ ans on disp@@ la@@ y , there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for fa@@ il@@ ure .
And so when people make deci@@ sions , and even though the resul@@ ts of the deci@@ sions are good , they feel dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted about them ;
they bla@@ me themselves .
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has exp@@ lo@@ ded in the industri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation .
I believe a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant -- not the only , but a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant -- cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tor to this expl@@ os@@ ion of de@@ pres@@ sion , and also su@@ ici@@ de , is that people have experi@@ ences that are dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting because their stand@@ ar@@ ds are so high ,
and then when they have to expla@@ in these experi@@ ences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fa@@ ul@@ t .
And so the net resul@@ t is that we do better in gener@@ al , objec@@ ti@@ vely , and we feel wor@@ se .
So let me re@@ mind you .
This is the off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all f@@ al@@ se .
It is not true .
There &apos;s no question that some cho@@ ice is better than n@@ one , but it doesn &apos;t fol@@ low from that that more cho@@ ice is better than some cho@@ ice .
There &apos;s some mag@@ ical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pretty con@@ fi@@ dent that we have long since pas@@ sed the point where op@@ tions im@@ pro@@ ve our wel@@ f@@ are .
Now , as a po@@ lic@@ y matter -- I &apos;m almost done -- as a po@@ lic@@ y matter , the thing to think about is this :
what en@@ ab@@ les all of this cho@@ ice in industri@@ al soc@@ ie@@ ties is mater@@ ial aff@@ lu@@ ence .
There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about sever@@ al of them , where their problem is not that they have too much cho@@ ice . The@@ ir problem is that they have too little .
So the stuff I &apos;m talking about is the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of moder@@ n , aff@@ lu@@ ent , West@@ er@@ n soc@@ ie@@ ties .
And what is so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and inf@@ ur@@ i@@ ating is this : Ste@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t talked to you ye@@ ster@@ day about how these exp@@ en@@ sive and difficul@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . It &apos;s a wa@@ ste of money .
What I &apos;m telling you is that these exp@@ en@@ sive , comp@@ lic@@ ated cho@@ ices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help . They actually h@@ urt .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our soc@@ ie@@ ties to make all of the cho@@ ices we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to soc@@ ie@@ ties in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be im@@ pro@@ ved ,
but ours would be im@@ pro@@ ved also ,
which is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; P@@ are@@ to@@ -@@ im@@ pro@@ ving move . &quot;
In@@ come re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this exc@@ ess cho@@ ice pla@@ gu@@ es us .
So to con@@ clu@@ de . &#91; You can be anything you want to be -- no lim@@ its &#93; You &apos;re sup@@ posed to read this car@@ t@@ oon , and , being a s@@ op@@ hi@@ st@@ ic@@ ated person , say , &quot; A@@ h ! What does this fish know ?
You know , nothing is possible in this f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l . &quot;
I@@ mp@@ over@@ is@@ hed ima@@ gin@@ ation , a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way I read it at first .
The more I thought about it , ho@@ we@@ ver , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something .
Because the tru@@ th of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have f@@ ree@@ dom . You have par@@ al@@ ys@@ is .
If you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
E@@ very@@ body needs a f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
This one is almost certain@@ ly too lim@@ ited -- perhaps even for the fish , certain@@ ly for us .
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ cip@@ e for mis@@ er@@ y , and , I su@@ sp@@ ect , di@@ sa@@ ster .
Thank you very much .
