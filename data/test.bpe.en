S@@ e@@ ver@@ al years ago here at TED , P@@ e@@ ter S@@ k@@ ill@@ man in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed a design ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge
called the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
And the idea &apos;s pret@@ ty simp@@ le : T@@ e@@ am@@ s of four have to buil@@ d the tal@@ le@@ st f@@ ree@@ -@@ stand@@ ing struc@@ ture out of 20 st@@ ic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ het@@ t@@ i , one y@@ ard of t@@ ap@@ e , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low .
The mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low has to be on top .
And , thou@@ gh it se@@ em@@ s really simp@@ le , it &apos;s actually pret@@ ty hard because it for@@ ces people to col@@ la@@ bor@@ ate very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op .
And it was a hu@@ ge succ@@ ess .
And sin@@ ce then , I &apos;ve con@@ duc@@ ted about 7@@ 0 design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ s ac@@ ros@@ s the world with stu@@ den@@ ts and desig@@ n@@ ers and arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts , even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ e 50 ,
and there &apos;s something about this ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se that re@@ ve@@ als very de@@ ep le@@ ss@@ ons about the nat@@ ure of col@@ la@@ bor@@ ation , and I &apos;d like to sh@@ are some of them with you .
So , nor@@ m@@ ally , most people begin by or@@ i@@ en@@ ting the@@ m@@ selves to the t@@ as@@ k .
They talk about it , they fig@@ ure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they j@@ oc@@ ke@@ y for power .
Th@@ en they sp@@ end some time plan@@ ning , organ@@ iz@@ ing ,
they s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ ag@@ het@@ t@@ i .
They sp@@ end the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of their time as@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ing the st@@ ic@@ ks into e@@ ver@@ -@@ gro@@ wing struc@@ tu@@ res .
And then fin@@ ally , just as they &apos;re r@@ un@@ ning out of time , some@@ one ta@@ kes out the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ d@@ a ! --
they ad@@ m@@ ire their work .
But what really happ@@ ens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ d@@ a &quot; tur@@ ns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h , &quot; because the we@@ i@@ ght of the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low c@@ au@@ ses the enti@@ re struc@@ ture to b@@ uc@@ k@@ le and to col@@ l@@ ap@@ se .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h &quot; mom@@ ents than o@@ th@@ ers ,
and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ ates of bu@@ sin@@ ess school .
They lie , they ch@@ e@@ at , they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produc@@ e really la@@ me struc@@ tu@@ res .
And of course there are te@@ am@@ s that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ d@@ a &quot; struc@@ tu@@ res ,
and am@@ ong the best are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten .
And it &apos;s pret@@ ty a@@ ma@@ zing .
A@@ s P@@ e@@ ter tel@@ ls us , not only do they produc@@ e the tal@@ le@@ st struc@@ tu@@ res , but they &apos;re the most interesting struc@@ tu@@ res of them all .
So the question you want to as@@ k is : How come ? Wh@@ y ? What is it about them ?
And P@@ e@@ ter li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the kids sp@@ end any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pa@@ g@@ het@@ t@@ i , In@@ c . Ri@@ ght ?
They don &apos;t sp@@ end time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for power .
But there &apos;s another reas@@ on as well .
And the reas@@ on is that bu@@ sin@@ ess stu@@ den@@ ts are tra@@ in@@ ed to find the s@@ ing@@ le right pl@@ an , right ?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te on it .
And then what happ@@ ens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low on the top , they ru@@ n out of time and what happ@@ ens ?
It &apos;s a c@@ ris@@ is .
S@@ ound fam@@ ili@@ ar ? Ri@@ ght .
What kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ en@@ tly
is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ,
and they buil@@ d prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , succ@@ es@@ si@@ ve prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es ,
always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low on top , so they have m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they buil@@ d prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es al@@ ong the way .
De@@ sig@@ n@@ ers rec@@ og@@ ni@@ ze this typ@@ e of col@@ la@@ bor@@ ation as the es@@ sen@@ ce of the it@@ er@@ ative proc@@ ess .
And with each ver@@ sion , kids get inst@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what wor@@ ks and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to pla@@ y in prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e is really es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al ,
but let &apos;s look at how different te@@ am@@ s per@@ form .
So the a@@ ver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es ;
bu@@ sin@@ ess sch@@ oo@@ ls stu@@ den@@ ts , about half of that ; la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , a little better , but not much better than that ,
kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most ad@@ ul@@ ts .
Wh@@ o does the very best ?
A@@ r@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts and en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers , th@@ an@@ k@@ f@@ ul@@ ly .
Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ch@@ es is the tal@@ le@@ st struc@@ ture I &apos;ve s@@ een .
And why is it ? Because they understand tri@@ an@@ g@@ les and sel@@ f@@ -@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ing ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical pat@@ ter@@ ns are the ke@@ y to building st@@ able struc@@ tu@@ res .
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s , a little bit better than a@@ ver@@ age ,
but here &apos;s where it ge@@ ts interesting . If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am , they get sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly better .
It &apos;s incre@@ di@@ ble . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that te@@ am &apos;s going to w@@ in . &quot;
You can just tell befor@@ e@@ hand . And why is that ?
Because they have spec@@ ial sk@@ il@@ ls of fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation .
They man@@ age the proc@@ ess , they understand the proc@@ ess .
And any te@@ am who man@@ a@@ ges and pa@@ ys cl@@ ose at@@ ten@@ tion to work will sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly im@@ pro@@ ve the te@@ am &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ ized sk@@ il@@ ls and fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation sk@@ il@@ ls are the com@@ bin@@ ation that lea@@ ds to str@@ ong succ@@ ess .
If you have 10 te@@ am@@ s that typ@@ ically per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe si@@ x or so that have stand@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ res .
And I tr@@ ied something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , on@@ ce .
So I off@@ er@@ ed a 1@@ 0@@ ,000 dollar pri@@ ze of s@@ of@@ tw@@ are to the win@@ ning te@@ am .
So what do you think happened to these design stu@@ den@@ ts ?
What was the resul@@ t ?
Here &apos;s what happened :
No@@ t one te@@ am had a stand@@ ing struc@@ ture .
If any@@ one had buil@@ t , say , a one in@@ ch struc@@ ture , they would have ta@@ ken h@@ ome the pri@@ ze .
So , is@@ n &apos;t that interesting ? That hi@@ gh sta@@ kes have a str@@ ong imp@@ act .
We did the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se again with the same stu@@ den@@ ts .
What do you think happened then ?
So now they understand the val@@ ue of prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ing .
So the same te@@ am went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very best .
They produc@@ ed the tal@@ le@@ st struc@@ tu@@ res in the lea@@ st am@@ oun@@ t of time .
So there &apos;s de@@ ep le@@ ss@@ ons for us about the nat@@ ure of in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves and succ@@ ess .
So , you might as@@ k : Wh@@ y would any@@ one actually sp@@ end time wr@@ it@@ ing a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge ?
And the reas@@ on is , I help create dig@@ it@@ al t@@ oo@@ ls and proc@@ ess@@ es to help te@@ am@@ s buil@@ d c@@ ars and vide@@ o g@@ am@@ es and vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ec@@ ts .
And what the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge does is it hel@@ ps them i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y the hi@@ dden as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions .
Because , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
The ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge pro@@ vide@@ s a sh@@ ar@@ ed experi@@ ence , a comm@@ on lan@@ gu@@ age , a comm@@ on st@@ ance to buil@@ d the right prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
And so , this is the val@@ ue of the experi@@ ence , of this so simp@@ le ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
And those of you who are interest@@ ed may want to go to M@@ ar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ w@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ .
It &apos;s a b@@ lo@@ g that you can look at how to buil@@ d the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ ws .
There &apos;s ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ ste@@ p in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
There are c@@ ra@@ z@@ y exam@@ p@@ les from around the world of how people twe@@ a@@ k and ad@@ just the system .
There &apos;s world rec@@ or@@ ds that are on this as well .
And the fun@@ da@@ men@@ tal le@@ ss@@ on , I believe , is that design tru@@ ly is a cont@@ act sp@@ ort .
It de@@ m@@ and@@ s that we br@@ ing all of our sen@@ ses to the t@@ as@@ k , and that we app@@ ly the very best of our thinking , our fe@@ el@@ ing and our doing to the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge that we have at hand .
And some@@ times , a little prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e of this experi@@ ence is all that it ta@@ kes to tur@@ n us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ d@@ a &quot; moment .
And that can make a big differ@@ ence .
Thank you very much .
L@@ et &apos;s pret@@ end right here we have a mach@@ ine . A big mach@@ ine , a c@@ ool , TE@@ D@@ -@@ ish mach@@ ine , and it &apos;s a time mach@@ ine .
And every@@ one in this r@@ oom has to get into it .
And you can go bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds , you can go for@@ war@@ ds ; you c@@ an@@ not sta@@ y where you are .
And I w@@ onder what you &apos;d ch@@ o@@ ose , because I &apos;ve been as@@ king my fri@@ en@@ ds this question a lot l@@ at@@ ely and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were au@@ t@@ om@@ o@@ bi@@ les or T@@ wit@@ ter or &quot; Amer@@ ic@@ an I@@ do@@ l . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m con@@ vin@@ c@@ ed that there &apos;s some sort of p@@ ul@@ l to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a , to wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous . It &apos;s because pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities on this plan@@ et ,
they don &apos;t go back , they go for@@ ward .
So I want to get in the mach@@ ine , and I want to go for@@ ward .
This is the gre@@ at@@ est time there &apos;s ever been on this plan@@ et by any me@@ as@@ ure that you w@@ ish to ch@@ o@@ ose : heal@@ th , we@@ al@@ th , mo@@ bil@@ ity , op@@ port@@ un@@ ity , de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing r@@ ates of di@@ se@@ ase ...
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
My gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents di@@ ed , all of them , by the time they were 6@@ 0 .
My gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents p@@ us@@ he@@ d that number to 7@@ 0 .
My par@@ ents are c@@ los@@ ing in on 8@@ 0 .
So there better be a n@@ ine at the begin@@ ning of my de@@ at@@ h number .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us ,
because this is a bi@@ g@@ ger de@@ al than that .
A k@@ id bor@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i today can exp@@ ect to live as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
Th@@ in@@ k about that , it &apos;s an incre@@ di@@ ble fact .
And why is it tru@@ e ?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x kil@@ led bil@@ li@@ ons of people on this plan@@ et .
It re@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed the de@@ mo@@ grap@@ h@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no wa@@ r ever has .
It &apos;s g@@ one . It &apos;s van@@ is@@ he@@ d .
We van@@ qu@@ is@@ he@@ d it . P@@ u@@ ff .
In the r@@ ich world , di@@ se@@ as@@ es that th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed mil@@ li@@ ons of us just a gener@@ ation ago no l@@ on@@ ger ex@@ ist , har@@ d@@ ly .
D@@ i@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia , ru@@ bel@@ l@@ a , po@@ li@@ o ...
does any@@ one even know what those things are ?
V@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es , mo@@ der@@ n me@@ dic@@ ine , our abil@@ ity to fe@@ ed bil@@ li@@ ons of people , those are tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s of the sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic me@@ th@@ od .
And to my m@@ ind , the sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic me@@ th@@ od -- trying stuff out , se@@ e@@ ing if it wor@@ ks , chan@@ ging it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments of hu@@ man@@ ity .
So that &apos;s the good ne@@ ws .
U@@ n@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , that &apos;s all the good ne@@ ws because there are some other proble@@ ms , and they &apos;ve been men@@ tion@@ ed many times . And one of them is that de@@ sp@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments , a bil@@ lion people go to be@@ d h@@ un@@ gr@@ y in this world every day .
That number &apos;s ri@@ sing , and it &apos;s ri@@ sing really r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly , and it &apos;s di@@ s@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ u@@ l .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our ima@@ gin@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tra@@ sh this g@@ lo@@ be .
P@@ ot@@ able water , ar@@ able land , ra@@ in@@ for@@ est@@ s , o@@ il , g@@ as : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away s@@ oon , and un@@ less we in@@ no@@ v@@ ate our way out of this me@@ ss , we &apos;re going away too .
So the question is : C@@ an we do that ? And I think we can .
I think it &apos;s c@@ le@@ ar that we can make food that will fe@@ ed bil@@ li@@ ons of people with@@ out r@@ ap@@ ing the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also de@@ st@@ ro@@ y it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it a@@ in &apos;t wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
But here &apos;s the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght :
We &apos;ve never ne@@ e@@ ded pro@@ gre@@ ss in sci@@ ence more than we need it right now . Ne@@ ver . And we &apos;ve also never been in a pos@@ it@@ ion to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can today .
We &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of a@@ ma@@ zing , a@@ ma@@ zing e@@ ven@@ ts in many fi@@ el@@ ds ,
and y@@ et I actually think we &apos;d have to go back h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds , 3@@ 00 years , before the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we b@@ at@@ t@@ led pro@@ gre@@ ss , when we f@@ ou@@ ght about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous@@ ly , on more f@@ ron@@ ts , than we do now . P@@ e@@ ople w@@ ra@@ p the@@ m@@ selves in their bel@@ ie@@ f@@ s ,
and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ tly that you can &apos;t set them f@@ ree . No@@ t even the tru@@ th will set them f@@ ree .
And , li@@ sten , every@@ one &apos;s en@@ tit@@ led to their op@@ in@@ ion ; they &apos;re even en@@ tit@@ led to their op@@ in@@ ion about pro@@ gre@@ ss . But you know what you &apos;re not en@@ tit@@ led to ?
You &apos;re not en@@ tit@@ led to your own fac@@ ts . S@@ or@@ ry , you &apos;re not .
And this took me a@@ wh@@ ile to fig@@ ure out .
A@@ b@@ out a de@@ ca@@ de ago , I wr@@ ot@@ e a story about v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es for The New Yor@@ ker . A little story .
And I was a@@ ma@@ z@@ ed to find op@@ pos@@ it@@ ion : op@@ pos@@ it@@ ion to what is , after all , the most eff@@ ec@@ tive pub@@ li@@ c heal@@ th me@@ as@@ ure in human hi@@ story .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wr@@ ot@@ e a story and I mo@@ ved on .
And s@@ oon after that , I wr@@ ot@@ e a story about gene@@ tic@@ ally en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ed food .
S@@ a@@ me thing , only bi@@ g@@ ger .
P@@ e@@ ople were going c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
So I wr@@ ot@@ e a story about that too , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; F@@ ran@@ ken@@ f@@ oo@@ ds , &quot; why they thought mo@@ ving mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les around in a speci@@ f@@ ic , ra@@ ther than a h@@ ap@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on nat@@ ure &apos;s gr@@ ound .
But , you know , I do what I do . I wr@@ ot@@ e the story , I mo@@ ved on . I mean , I &apos;m a j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ st . We typ@@ e , we fil@@ e , we go to din@@ ner . It &apos;s f@@ ine .
But these stor@@ ies bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t fig@@ ure out why , and e@@ ven@@ tually I did .
And that &apos;s because those fan@@ at@@ ics that were dri@@ ving me c@@ ra@@ z@@ y wer@@ en &apos;t actually fan@@ at@@ ics at all .
They were thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful people , e@@ duc@@ ated people , de@@ cent people .
They were ex@@ ac@@ tly like the people in this r@@ oom .
And it just di@@ st@@ ur@@ be@@ d me so much .
But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be h@@ on@@ est . We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to pro@@ gre@@ ss that we used to .
We talk about it am@@ bi@@ val@@ en@@ tly .
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic ter@@ ms with little quot@@ es around it :
&quot; pro@@ gre@@ ss . &quot;
Ok@@ ay , there are reas@@ ons for that , and I think we know what those reas@@ ons are .
We &apos;ve l@@ ost fa@@ it@@ h in inst@@ itu@@ tions , in au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , and some@@ times in sci@@ ence it@@ self , and there &apos;s no reas@@ on we sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t have .
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will understand .
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l , B@@ hop@@ al , the Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger , V@@ i@@ o@@ x@@ x , we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ ss de@@ struc@@ tion , han@@ ging ch@@ a@@ ds .
You know , you can ch@@ o@@ ose your li@@ st .
There are quest@@ i@@ ons and proble@@ ms with the people we used to believe were always right ,
so be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ al .
A@@ s@@ k quest@@ i@@ ons , de@@ mand pr@@ oo@@ f , de@@ mand e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce . D@@ on &apos;t take any@@ thing for gr@@ an@@ ted .
But here &apos;s the thing : When you get pr@@ oo@@ f , you need to ac@@ cep@@ t the pr@@ oo@@ f , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
And the reas@@ on that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c of fe@@ ar like one I &apos;ve never s@@ een and hop@@ e never to see again .
A@@ b@@ out 1@@ 2 years ago , there was a story pub@@ li@@ s@@ he@@ d , a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c of au@@ ti@@ s@@ m to the me@@ as@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ bel@@ l@@ a v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine sho@@ t .
Ver@@ y sc@@ ary .
T@@ ons of stu@@ di@@ es were done to see if this was tru@@ e .
T@@ ons of stu@@ di@@ es should have been done ; it &apos;s a ser@@ i@@ ous is@@ su@@ e .
The data came back .
The data came back from the U@@ n@@ ited St@@ ates , from En@@ g@@ land , from S@@ we@@ den , from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , and it was all the same : no cor@@ rel@@ ation , no con@@ nec@@ tion , n@@ one at all .
It doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter . It doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what ma@@ kes us feel real .
We don &apos;t believe a b@@ un@@ ch of do@@ cu@@ ments from a go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment off@@ ic@@ ial gi@@ ving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
But you know what ?
The resul@@ t of that has been di@@ sa@@ str@@ ous . D@@ is@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : The U@@ n@@ ited St@@ ates is one of the only coun@@ tries in the world where the v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine r@@ ate for me@@ as@@ les is going down .
That is di@@ s@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ u@@ l , and we should be as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed of our@@ selves .
It &apos;s h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble .
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
Now , I understand it . I do understand it .
Because , did any@@ one have me@@ as@@ les here ?
H@@ as one person in this au@@ di@@ ence ever s@@ een some@@ one die of me@@ as@@ les ?
D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t happ@@ en very much .
D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t happ@@ en in this country at all , but it happened 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ ,000 times in the world last year .
That &apos;s a lot of de@@ at@@ h of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an h@@ our .
But sin@@ ce it didn &apos;t happ@@ en here , we can put it out of our min@@ ds , and people like J@@ en@@ n@@ y M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing me@@ s@@ sa@@ ges of fe@@ ar and il@@ lit@@ er@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms like &quot; O@@ pra@@ h &quot; and &quot; L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing L@@ i@@ ve . &quot;
And they can do it because they don &apos;t lin@@ k c@@ au@@ s@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things se@@ em the same , but they &apos;re al@@ most never the same .
And it &apos;s something we need to lear@@ n , and we need to lear@@ n it really s@@ oon .
This gu@@ y was a her@@ o , J@@ on@@ as S@@ alk .
He took one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
No fe@@ ar , no ag@@ on@@ y . P@@ o@@ li@@ o -- pu@@ ff , g@@ one .
That gu@@ y in the mid@@ d@@ le , not so much .
H@@ is na@@ me is P@@ au@@ l O@@ ff@@ it .
He just develop@@ ed a r@@ ot@@ a@@ vi@@ ru@@ s v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine with a b@@ un@@ ch of other people .
It &apos;ll sa@@ ve the li@@ ves of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 kids in the develop@@ ing world every year .
P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , ex@@ cep@@ t that P@@ au@@ l go@@ es around tal@@ king about v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es and says how val@@ u@@ able they are
and that people ou@@ ght to just st@@ op the wh@@ in@@ ing .
And he actually says it that way .
So , P@@ au@@ l &apos;s a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist .
When P@@ au@@ l sp@@ ea@@ ks in a pub@@ li@@ c he@@ aring , he can &apos;t te@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ y with@@ out ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds .
He ge@@ ts called at h@@ ome because people like to tell him that they re@@ me@@ mber where his kids go to school .
And why ? Because P@@ au@@ l made a v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es are es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al .
You take them away , di@@ se@@ ase comes back , h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble di@@ se@@ as@@ es . And that &apos;s happen@@ ing .
We have me@@ as@@ les in this country now .
And it &apos;s getting wor@@ se , and pret@@ ty s@@ oon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a nu@@ mb@@ ers ga@@ me .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of me@@ as@@ les .
What about po@@ li@@ o ? L@@ et &apos;s have that . Wh@@ y not ?
A col@@ le@@ ge c@@ la@@ ss@@ m@@ ate of m@@ ine wr@@ ot@@ e me a cou@@ ple we@@ e@@ ks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ dent .
No one &apos;s ever said that before .
S@@ he wa@@ sn &apos;t going to v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ate her k@@ id aga@@ in@@ st po@@ li@@ o ,
no way .
F@@ ine .
Wh@@ y ? Because we don &apos;t have po@@ li@@ o . And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have po@@ li@@ o in this country ye@@ ster@@ day .
To@@ day , I don &apos;t know , maybe a gu@@ y got on a plan@@ e in La@@ go@@ s this mor@@ ning , and he &apos;s fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X , right now he &apos;s over O@@ hi@@ o .
And he &apos;s going to land in a cou@@ ple of h@@ our@@ s , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a c@@ ar , and he &apos;s going to come to L@@ ong B@@ each , and he &apos;s going to at@@ t@@ end one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED din@@ n@@ ers ton@@ i@@ ght .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s inf@@ ec@@ ted with a par@@ al@@ y@@ tic di@@ se@@ ase , and we don &apos;t ei@@ ther because that &apos;s the way the world wor@@ ks .
That &apos;s the plan@@ et we live on . D@@ on &apos;t pret@@ end it is@@ n &apos;t .
Now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p our@@ selves in l@@ ies . We love to do it .
E@@ very@@ one take their v@@ it@@ am@@ ins this mor@@ ning ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little an@@ ti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Amer@@ ic@@ ans do every day .
They take the stuff , and they take al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative me@@ dic@@ in@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter how of@@ ten we find out that they &apos;re u@@ sel@@ ess .
The data says it all the time .
They d@@ ar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . They al@@ most never do more than that .
It &apos;s o@@ k@@ ay , you want to pa@@ y 2@@ 8 bil@@ lion dollars for d@@ ar@@ k ur@@ ine ? I &apos;m tot@@ ally with you .
D@@ ar@@ k ur@@ ine . D@@ ar@@ k .
Wh@@ y do we do that ? Wh@@ y do we do that ? Well , I think I understand , we h@@ ate B@@ ig P@@ har@@ ma .
We h@@ ate B@@ ig G@@ over@@ n@@ ment . We don &apos;t tru@@ st the M@@ an .
And we sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t : O@@ ur heal@@ th c@@ are system suc@@ ks .
It &apos;s c@@ ru@@ el to mil@@ li@@ ons of people .
It &apos;s ab@@ solu@@ tely a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly c@@ old and s@@ ou@@ l@@ -@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even af@@ for@@ d it .
So we ru@@ n away from it , and where do we ru@@ n ?
We lea@@ p into the ar@@ ms of B@@ ig P@@ l@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o .
That &apos;s fan@@ tast@@ ic . I love B@@ ig P@@ l@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o .
But , you know , it &apos;s really a ser@@ i@@ ous thing because this stuff is c@@ ra@@ p , and we sp@@ end bil@@ li@@ ons of dollars on it .
And I have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ ps here .
N@@ one of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , f@@ ra@@ u@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , f@@ ra@@ u@@ d ; ac@@ a@@ i -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding bil@@ li@@ ons of dollars on it -- it &apos;s f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
And you know what ? When I say this stuff , people sc@@ re@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; What do you c@@ are ? L@@ et people do what they want to do .
It ma@@ kes them feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;re wr@@ ong .
Because I don &apos;t c@@ are if it &apos;s the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who &apos;s sa@@ ying , &quot; H@@ m@@ m , I &apos;m not going to take the e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of my ex@@ per@@ ts on ma@@ m@@ mo@@ gra@@ ms , &quot;
or some c@@ anc@@ er qu@@ ack who wan@@ ts to tre@@ at his p@@ ati@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ e@@ e en@@ e@@ ma@@ s .
When you start down the ro@@ ad where bel@@ ief and ma@@ gi@@ c re@@ place e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce and sci@@ ence , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
You end up in T@@ ha@@ b@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i S@@ ou@@ th Africa .
He kil@@ led 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ si@@ st@@ ing that be@@ e@@ tr@@ oo@@ t , g@@ ar@@ li@@ c and le@@ m@@ on o@@ il were much more eff@@ ec@@ tive than the an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al dru@@ gs we know can s@@ low the course of A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of ne@@ ed@@ less de@@ a@@ th@@ s in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this di@@ se@@ ase .
P@@ lea@@ se , don &apos;t tell me there are no con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces to these things .
There are . There always are .
Now , the most min@@ d@@ less ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ c we &apos;re in the mid@@ d@@ le of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d b@@ at@@ tle between pro@@ p@@ on@@ ents of gene@@ tic@@ ally en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ed food and the organ@@ ic el@@ ite .
It &apos;s an i@@ di@@ ot@@ ic de@@ b@@ ate . It has to st@@ op .
It &apos;s a de@@ b@@ ate about wor@@ ds , about me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ors .
It &apos;s ide@@ olog@@ y , it &apos;s not sci@@ ence .
E@@ very s@@ ing@@ le thing we e@@ at , every gra@@ in of r@@ ice , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sle@@ y , every B@@ ru@@ s@@ sel@@ s sp@@ r@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ f@@ ied by man .
You know , there wer@@ en &apos;t t@@ an@@ ger@@ in@@ es in the g@@ ar@@ den of E@@ den .
There wa@@ sn &apos;t any c@@ an@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e .
There wer@@ en &apos;t Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s tre@@ es . We made it all .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years .
And some of it wor@@ ked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
We got ri@@ d of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ ci@@ se way --
and there are ris@@ ks , ab@@ solu@@ tely --
but we can put something like v@@ it@@ am@@ in A into r@@ ice , and that stuff can help mil@@ li@@ ons of people , mil@@ li@@ ons of people , pro@@ long their li@@ ves .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
We ob@@ ject to gene@@ tic@@ ally en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ed food .
Wh@@ y do we do that ?
Well , the things I con@@ stan@@ tly he@@ ar are : To@@ o many ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als , pe@@ st@@ ic@@ ide@@ s , h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture , we don &apos;t want gi@@ ant fi@@ el@@ ds of the same thing , that &apos;s wr@@ ong .
We don &apos;t comp@@ an@@ ies pat@@ en@@ ting life .
We don &apos;t want comp@@ an@@ ies o@@ w@@ ning se@@ eds .
And you know what my resp@@ on@@ se to all of that is ?
Y@@ es , you &apos;re right . L@@ et &apos;s fi@@ x it .
It &apos;s tru@@ e , we &apos;ve got a hu@@ ge food problem , but this is@@ n &apos;t sci@@ ence .
This has no@@ thing to do with sci@@ ence .
It &apos;s la@@ w , it &apos;s mor@@ al@@ ity , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
You know sci@@ ence is@@ n &apos;t a comp@@ any .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a proc@@ ess .
It &apos;s a proc@@ ess , and some@@ times it wor@@ ks and some@@ times it doesn &apos;t ,
but the idea that we should not al@@ low sci@@ ence to do its jo@@ b because we &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id , is really very de@@ a@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ ven@@ ting mil@@ li@@ ons of people from pr@@ os@@ per@@ ing .
You know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to gro@@ w 7@@ 0 percent more food than we do right now ,
7@@ 0 percent .
This in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years .
D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ u@@ l . D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ u@@ l .
They need it , and we &apos;re not gi@@ ving it to them .
And why ? G@@ en@@ e@@ tic@@ ally en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ed food .
We don &apos;t want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge people to e@@ at that r@@ ot@@ ten stuff , like c@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a for inst@@ ance .
C@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a &apos;s something that half a bil@@ lion people e@@ at . It &apos;s kind of like a p@@ ot@@ at@@ o .
It &apos;s just a b@@ un@@ ch of c@@ al@@ or@@ ies . It suc@@ ks .
It doesn &apos;t have nu@@ tri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have prot@@ e@@ in , and sci@@ enti@@ sts are en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ing all of that into it right now .
And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they &apos;d be able to not go bl@@ ind .
They w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
That would be n@@ ice . It w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se , but it would be n@@ ice .
And all I can say about this is : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s as@@ k our@@ selves : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
Because we don &apos;t want to mo@@ ve gen@@ es around ?
This is about mo@@ ving gen@@ es around . It &apos;s not about ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als .
It &apos;s not about our ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous pas@@ sion for h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , our in@@ si@@ st@@ ence on ha@@ ving bi@@ g@@ ger food , better food , s@@ ing@@ u@@ lar food .
This is@@ n &apos;t about R@@ ice K@@ ri@@ sp@@ ies , this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve ,
and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that me@@ ant .
Because , you know something ?
If we don &apos;t , if we contin@@ ue to act the way we &apos;re ac@@ ting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : hi@@ gh@@ -@@ t@@ ec@@ h col@@ on@@ i@@ alis@@ m .
There &apos;s no other way to de@@ scri@@ be what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s sel@@ f@@ ish , it &apos;s u@@ g@@ ly , it &apos;s ben@@ e@@ at@@ h us , and we really have to st@@ op it .
So after this a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly fu@@ n con@@ vers@@ ation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous time mach@@ ine and go for@@ ward ? &quot;
A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely . A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely , I do .
It &apos;s st@@ uc@@ k in the pres@@ ent right now , but we have an a@@ ma@@ zing op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .
We can set that time mach@@ ine on any@@ thing we want .
We can mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it , and we &apos;re going to mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it .
We have to have these con@@ vers@@ ations and we have to think , but when we get in the time mach@@ ine and we go a@@ he@@ ad , we &apos;re going to be happ@@ y we do .
I know that we can , and as f@@ ar as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned , that &apos;s something the world ne@@ eds right now .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
One day , L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es T@@ im@@ es col@@ u@@ m@@ ni@@ st
S@@ te@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was wal@@ king al@@ ong
the st@@ ree@@ ts of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es
when he he@@ ard beau@@ ti@@ ful mu@@ sic .
And the s@@ our@@ ce was a man ,
an Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Amer@@ ic@@ an man ,
char@@ ming , ru@@ g@@ ged , h@@ om@@ el@@ ess ,
pla@@ ying a vi@@ ol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
And I &apos;m tel@@ ling a story that many of you know ,
because S@@ te@@ ve &apos;s col@@ u@@ m@@ ns bec@@ a@@ me the bas@@ is
for a b@@ ook , which was tur@@ ned into a mo@@ v@@ ie ,
with R@@ o@@ ber@@ t D@@ o@@ w@@ ne@@ y J@@ r@@ . ac@@ ting as S@@ te@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z ,
and J@@ am@@ ie F@@ o@@ x@@ x as N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ ers ,
the J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed d@@ ou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st
wh@@ ose pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing car@@ e@@ er was c@@ ut sh@@ ort
by a tra@@ gi@@ c a@@ ff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia .
N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed out of J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed a comple@@ te bre@@ a@@ k@@ down ,
and 30 years later he was li@@ ving h@@ om@@ el@@ ess
on the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge all of you to re@@ ad S@@ te@@ ve &apos;s b@@ ook or to wat@@ ch the mo@@ v@@ ie
to understand not only the beau@@ ti@@ ful b@@ ond
that form@@ ed between these two men ,
but how mu@@ sic hel@@ p@@ ed sh@@ ap@@ e that b@@ ond ,
and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely was in@@ stru@@ men@@ tal -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n --
in hel@@ p@@ ing N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l get off the st@@ ree@@ ts .
I met M@@ r@@ . A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8 ,
two years ago , at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all .
He had just he@@ ard a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ ir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sy@@ mp@@ h@@ on@@ ies ,
and came bac@@ k@@ sta@@ ge and in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed hi@@ m@@ self .
He was sp@@ ea@@ king in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way
about Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton
and how the D@@ o@@ d@@ g@@ ers were never going to make the W@@ or@@ ld S@@ er@@ ies ,
all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ ol@@ in pas@@ sa@@ ge work
in the last mo@@ ve@@ ment of B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ our@@ th S@@ y@@ mp@@ h@@ on@@ y .
And we got tal@@ king about mu@@ sic , and I got an e@@ ma@@ il from S@@ te@@ ve a few da@@ ys later
sa@@ ying that N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l was interest@@ ed in a vi@@ ol@@ in le@@ ss@@ on with me .
Now , I should men@@ tion that N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l re@@ f@@ us@@ es tre@@ at@@ ment
because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ c@@ k ther@@ ap@@ y
and Th@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s ,
and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ y@@ ed with him for his enti@@ re life .
But as a resul@@ t now , he is pr@@ one to
these sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ des ,
the wor@@ st of which can man@@ i@@ fe@@ st the@@ m@@ selves as
him exp@@ lo@@ ding
and then di@@ s@@ ap@@ pe@@ aring for da@@ ys ,
wan@@ der@@ ing the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow ,
ex@@ pos@@ ed to its h@@ or@@ r@@ ors , with the t@@ or@@ ment of his own m@@ ind
un@@ le@@ as@@ he@@ d up@@ on him .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l was in s@@ uch a st@@ ate of ag@@ it@@ ation
when we started our first le@@ ss@@ on at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all --
he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his ey@@ es ,
he was l@@ ost .
And he was tal@@ king about
in@@ vi@@ sible de@@ m@@ ons and s@@ mo@@ ke ,
and how some@@ one was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his sle@@ ep .
And I was af@@ ra@@ id ,
not for my@@ self , but I was af@@ ra@@ id
that I was going to l@@ ose him ,
that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his st@@ ates ,
and that I would ru@@ in his rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with the vi@@ ol@@ in
if I started tal@@ king about sc@@ al@@ es
and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ o@@ s and other ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing for@@ ms of
di@@ d@@ acti@@ c vi@@ ol@@ in pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y .
So , I just started pla@@ ying .
And I pla@@ y@@ ed the first mo@@ ve@@ ment of the B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven V@@ i@@ ol@@ in C@@ on@@ cer@@ to .
And as I pla@@ y@@ ed ,
I under@@ st@@ ood that there was a pro@@ found change
oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing in N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l &apos;s ey@@ es .
It was as if he was in the g@@ ri@@ p of some in@@ vi@@ sible ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al ,
a ch@@ em@@ ical re@@ ac@@ tion , for which my pla@@ ying the mu@@ sic
was its c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge
was trans@@ form@@ ed into under@@ stand@@ ing ,
a qu@@ i@@ et cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity and gr@@ ace .
And in a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le , he li@@ f@@ ted his own vi@@ ol@@ in
and he started pla@@ ying , by e@@ ar ,
cer@@ ta@@ in s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of vi@@ ol@@ in con@@ cer@@ to@@ s
which he then as@@ ked me to comple@@ te -- M@@ en@@ del@@ ss@@ o@@ h@@ n ,
T@@ ch@@ a@@ ik@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y , S@@ i@@ bel@@ i@@ us .
And we started tal@@ king about mu@@ sic , from B@@ ach
to B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven and B@@ ra@@ h@@ ms ,
B@@ ru@@ c@@ k@@ ner , all the B &apos;s ,
from B@@ ar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ P@@ e@@ kk@@ a S@@ al@@ on@@ en .
And I under@@ st@@ ood that he not only
had an en@@ c@@ y@@ cl@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of mu@@ sic ,
but he rel@@ ated to this mu@@ sic at a pers@@ on@@ al lev@@ el .
He sp@@ o@@ ke about it with the kind of pas@@ sion
and under@@ stand@@ ing that I sh@@ are with my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es
in the L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .
And through pla@@ ying mu@@ sic and tal@@ king about mu@@ sic ,
this man had trans@@ form@@ ed
from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , di@@ st@@ ur@@ be@@ d man
that had just come from wal@@ king the st@@ ree@@ ts
of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es
to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te ,
br@@ il@@ li@@ ant , J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed m@@ us@@ ici@@ an .
M@@ u@@ sic is me@@ dic@@ ine . M@@ u@@ sic chan@@ ges us .
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l , mu@@ sic is s@@ an@@ ity .
Because mu@@ sic al@@ lo@@ ws him to take his thou@@ gh@@ ts
and del@@ u@@ si@@ ons and sh@@ ap@@ e them
through his ima@@ gin@@ ation and his cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity ,
into real@@ ity .
And that is an e@@ sc@@ ap@@ e
from his t@@ or@@ men@@ ted st@@ ate .
And I under@@ st@@ ood that this was the very es@@ sen@@ ce of art .
This was the very reas@@ on why we made mu@@ sic ,
that we take something that ex@@ ist@@ s with@@ in all of us
at our very fun@@ da@@ men@@ tal cor@@ e ,
our em@@ ot@@ i@@ ons ,
and through our arti@@ st@@ ic l@@ ens ,
through our cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity , we &apos;re able to sh@@ ap@@ e those em@@ ot@@ i@@ ons into real@@ ity .
And the real@@ ity of that ex@@ pres@@ sion
re@@ ach@@ es all of us
and mo@@ ves us , in@@ sp@@ i@@ res and un@@ it@@ es us .
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l ,
mu@@ sic br@@ ou@@ ght him back into a f@@ old of fri@@ en@@ ds .
The re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of mu@@ sic br@@ ou@@ ght him back
into a fam@@ ily of m@@ us@@ ici@@ ans
that under@@ st@@ ood him ,
that rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ed his tal@@ ents
and re@@ spec@@ ted him .
And I will always make mu@@ sic with N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ ie@@ l ,
w@@ he@@ ther we &apos;re at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all
or on S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow , because he re@@ min@@ ds me
why I bec@@ a@@ me a m@@ us@@ ici@@ an .
Thank you .
B@@ r@@ un@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ an@@ i : Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks .
R@@ o@@ ber@@ t G@@ up@@ t@@ a .
R@@ o@@ ber@@ t G@@ up@@ t@@ a : I &apos;m going to pla@@ y something that I s@@ ha@@ m@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from cel@@ li@@ sts .
So , p@@ lea@@ se for@@ give me .
I &apos;m J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a ga@@ me desig@@ ner .
I &apos;ve been making g@@ am@@ es on@@ line now for 10 years ,
and my go@@ al for the next de@@ ca@@ de is to try to make it as e@@ as@@ y to sa@@ ve the world in real life as it is to sa@@ ve the world in on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
Now , I have a pl@@ an for this , and it en@@ ta@@ il@@ s con@@ vin@@ c@@ ing more people , in@@ clu@@ ding all of you , to sp@@ end more time pla@@ ying bi@@ g@@ ger and better g@@ am@@ es .
Ri@@ ght now we sp@@ end three bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ ek pla@@ ying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
S@@ ome of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to sp@@ end pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es .
Ma@@ ybe too much time , con@@ si@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gen@@ t proble@@ ms we have to sol@@ ve in the real world . &quot;
But actually , ac@@ cor@@ ding to my re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture , actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is tru@@ e .
Th@@ ree bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ ek is not ne@@ ar@@ ly enough ga@@ me pla@@ y to sol@@ ve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gen@@ t proble@@ ms .
In fact , I believe that if we want to sur@@ vi@@ ve the next cen@@ tur@@ y on this plan@@ et , we need to incre@@ ase that tot@@ al dra@@ mat@@ ically .
I &apos;ve c@@ al@@ cul@@ ated the tot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s of ga@@ me pla@@ y every we@@ ek .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ve idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in :
If we want to sol@@ ve proble@@ ms like h@@ un@@ ger , p@@ over@@ ty , c@@ lim@@ ate change , glob@@ al conf@@ lic@@ t , o@@ be@@ s@@ ity , I believe that we need to a@@ sp@@ ire to pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es on@@ line for at lea@@ st 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ ek , by the end of the next de@@ ca@@ de . No . I &apos;m ser@@ i@@ ous . I am .
Here &apos;s why . This pic@@ ture pret@@ ty much su@@ ms up why I think g@@ am@@ es are so es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al to the fu@@ ture sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of the human spec@@ ies . T@@ ru@@ ly .
This is a por@@ tra@@ it by ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ her P@@ hi@@ l To@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
He wanted to cap@@ ture the em@@ ot@@ ion of g@@ am@@ ing ,
so he set up a cam@@ er@@ a in f@@ ron@@ t of g@@ am@@ ers wh@@ ile they were pla@@ ying .
And this is a c@@ la@@ s@@ sic g@@ am@@ ing em@@ ot@@ ion .
Now , if you &apos;re not a g@@ am@@ er , you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this p@@ ho@@ to .
You probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y , a little bit of fe@@ ar , but in@@ ten@@ se con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation , de@@ ep , de@@ ep f@@ oc@@ us on t@@ ac@@ k@@ ling a really diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t problem .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er , you will not@@ ice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the ey@@ es up , and around the m@@ ou@@ th is a sig@@ n of op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m ,
and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is sur@@ pri@@ se .
This is a g@@ am@@ er who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an &quot; ep@@ ic w@@ in . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;ve he@@ ard of that .
OK , good , so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us .
A@@ n ep@@ ic w@@ in is an out@@ come that is so ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ar@@ ily pos@@ iti@@ ve , you had no idea it was even pos@@ sible un@@ ti@@ l you ach@@ ie@@ ved it .
It was al@@ most be@@ y@@ ond the th@@ re@@ sh@@ old of ima@@ gin@@ ation , and when you get there ,
you &apos;re sho@@ c@@ ked to disc@@ over what you &apos;re tru@@ ly cap@@ able of . That &apos;s an ep@@ ic w@@ in .
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic w@@ in .
And this is the face that we need to see on mil@@ li@@ ons of proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next cen@@ tur@@ y --
the face of some@@ one who , aga@@ in@@ st all o@@ d@@ ds , is on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic w@@ in .
Now , un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le ur@@ gen@@ t proble@@ ms .
This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m No@@ t G@@ ood A@@ t L@@ i@@ fe &quot; face .
This is actually me making it . C@@ an you see ? Y@@ es . G@@ ood .
This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m No@@ t G@@ ood A@@ t L@@ i@@ fe &quot; face .
This is a pie@@ ce of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood in B@@ er@@ kel@@ ey , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , where I did my P@@ h@@ D on why we &apos;re better in g@@ am@@ es than we are in real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers have .
We feel that we are not as good in real@@ ity as we are in g@@ am@@ es .
I don &apos;t mean just good as in succ@@ ess@@ ful , al@@ thou@@ gh that &apos;s part of it .
We do ach@@ ieve more in ga@@ me wor@@ l@@ ds . But I also mean good as in mot@@ i@@ v@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- in@@ sp@@ i@@ red to col@@ la@@ bor@@ ate and to c@@ oo@@ per@@ ate .
And when we &apos;re in ga@@ me wor@@ l@@ ds , I believe that many of us be@@ come the best ver@@ sion of our@@ selves -- the most li@@ kel@@ y to help at a moment &apos;s not@@ ice ,
the most li@@ kel@@ y to st@@ ick with a problem as long at it ta@@ kes , to get up after fa@@ il@@ ure and try again .
And in real life , when we face fa@@ il@@ ure , when we conf@@ ron@@ t ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les , we of@@ ten don &apos;t feel that way .
We feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed ,
we feel an@@ x@@ i@@ ous , maybe de@@ pre@@ ss@@ ed , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated or c@@ y@@ n@@ ical .
We never have those fe@@ el@@ ings when we &apos;re pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es ,
they just don &apos;t ex@@ ist in g@@ am@@ es .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to stu@@ dy when I was a gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dent .
What about g@@ am@@ es ma@@ kes it im@@ pos@@ sible to feel that we can &apos;t ach@@ ieve everything ?
How can we take those fe@@ el@@ ings from g@@ am@@ es and app@@ ly them to real@@ -@@ world work ?
So I loo@@ ked at g@@ am@@ es like W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft , which is really the ide@@ al col@@ la@@ bor@@ ative proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
And I started to not@@ ice a few things that make ep@@ ic win@@ s so pos@@ sible in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds .
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these on@@ line g@@ am@@ es , e@@ speci@@ ally in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft , there are l@@ ots and l@@ ots of different char@@ ac@@ ters who are wil@@ ling to tru@@ st you with a wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ sa@@ ving mis@@ sion , right away .
But not just any mis@@ sion , it &apos;s a mis@@ sion that is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly mat@@ ch@@ ed with your cur@@ r@@ ent lev@@ el in the ga@@ me .
Ri@@ ght ? So you can do it .
They never give you a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge you can &apos;t ach@@ ieve .
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re cap@@ able of , so you have to try hard .
But there &apos;s no un@@ em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ; no s@@ it@@ ting around ,
wr@@ ing@@ ing your hand@@ s --
there &apos;s always something speci@@ f@@ ic and important to be done .
There are also t@@ ons of col@@ la@@ bor@@ at@@ ors .
E@@ very@@ where you go , h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of people ready to work with you to ach@@ ieve your ep@@ ic mis@@ sion .
That &apos;s not something we have in real life that e@@ as@@ ily , this sense that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of col@@ la@@ bor@@ at@@ ors .
And there &apos;s this ep@@ ic story , this in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing ,
and we get all this pos@@ iti@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ back .
You gu@@ ys have he@@ ard of le@@ vel@@ ing up , + 1 str@@ en@@ g@@ th , + 1 intel@@ li@@ gen@@ ce .
We don &apos;t get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
When I get off this sta@@ ge , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 sp@@ ea@@ king , and + 1 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y idea , + 20 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y idea .
I don &apos;t get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
Now , the problem with col@@ la@@ bor@@ ative on@@ line en@@ vir@@ on@@ ments like W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft is that it &apos;s so s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic w@@ in all the time , we de@@ ci@@ de to sp@@ end all our time in these ga@@ me wor@@ l@@ ds .
It &apos;s just better than real@@ ity .
So , so f@@ ar , col@@ lec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y all the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have sp@@ ent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tu@@ al proble@@ ms of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h .
Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily a b@@ ad thing .
It might s@@ ound like it &apos;s a b@@ ad thing .
But to put that in con@@ te@@ xt : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ lie@@ st pri@@ m@@ ate human anc@@ est@@ ors st@@ ood up .
That was the first up@@ right pri@@ m@@ ate .
So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re cur@@ ren@@ tly in@@ ve@@ st@@ ing in pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , the only way it ma@@ kes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the ma@@ g@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evolu@@ tion , which is an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary thing .
But it &apos;s also ap@@ t , because it tur@@ ns out that by sp@@ en@@ ding all this time pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , we &apos;re actually chan@@ ging what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ings .
We &apos;re e@@ vol@@ ving to be a more col@@ la@@ bor@@ ative and he@@ ar@@ ty spec@@ ies .
This is tru@@ e . I believe this .
So , con@@ si@@ der this really interesting st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic ;
it was rec@@ en@@ tly pub@@ li@@ s@@ he@@ d by a re@@ se@@ arch@@ er at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ g@@ ie M@@ el@@ l@@ on U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity :
The a@@ ver@@ age y@@ oun@@ g person today in a country with a str@@ ong g@@ am@@ er cul@@ ture will have sp@@ ent 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s pla@@ ying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es by the age of 2@@ 1 .
Now 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s is a really interesting number for two reas@@ ons .
F@@ ir@@ st of all , for children in the U@@ n@@ ited St@@ ates , 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s is the ex@@ act am@@ oun@@ t of time you will sp@@ end in school , from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to hi@@ gh school gra@@ du@@ ation , if you have per@@ f@@ ect at@@ ten@@ d@@ ance .
So , we have an enti@@ re par@@ alle@@ l tr@@ ack of e@@ duc@@ ation going on , where y@@ oun@@ g people are lear@@ ning as much about what it ta@@ kes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they &apos;re lear@@ ning about everything el@@ se in school .
S@@ ome of you have probably re@@ ad M@@ al@@ col@@ m G@@ la@@ d@@ well &apos;s new b@@ ook &quot; O@@ u@@ t@@ li@@ ers , &quot;
so you would have he@@ ard of his theor@@ y of succ@@ ess , the &quot; 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s &quot; theor@@ y of succ@@ ess .
It &apos;s bas@@ ed on this great c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve@@ -@@ sci@@ ence re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch that says if we can ma@@ ster 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s of ef@@ for@@ t@@ ful stu@@ dy at any@@ thing by the age of 2@@ 1 , we will be vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at it .
We will be as good at wh@@ at@@ ever we do as the gre@@ at@@ est people in the world .
And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an enti@@ re gener@@ ation of y@@ oun@@ g people who are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ ers .
So , the big question is , &quot; What ex@@ ac@@ tly are g@@ am@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
Because if we could fig@@ ure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ pre@@ c@@ e@@ den@@ ted human res@@ our@@ ce on our hand@@ s .
This is how many people we now have in the world who sp@@ end at lea@@ st an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
These are our vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ ers ,
5@@ 00 million people who are ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ar@@ ily good at something .
And in the next de@@ ca@@ de , we &apos;re going to have another bil@@ lion g@@ am@@ ers who are ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ar@@ ily good at wh@@ at@@ ever that is .
If you don &apos;t know it al@@ ready , this is coming .
The ga@@ me indu@@ str@@ y is develop@@ ing con@@ s@@ o@@ les that are lo@@ w@@ -@@ energy and that work with the w@@ ir@@ el@@ ess ph@@ one net@@ wor@@ ks in@@ ste@@ ad of bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and In@@ ter@@ net , so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the world , parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly in India , Chin@@ a , B@@ ra@@ zi@@ l , can get on@@ line .
They exp@@ ect one bil@@ lion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next de@@ ca@@ de .
It will br@@ ing us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 bil@@ lion g@@ am@@ ers .
So I &apos;ve started to think about what these g@@ am@@ es are making us vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at .
Here are the four things I came up with . The first is ur@@ gen@@ t op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
OK , think of this as ex@@ tre@@ me sel@@ f@@ -@@ mot@@ i@@ v@@ ation .
U@@ r@@ gen@@ t op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m is the de@@ si@@ re to act im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , com@@ bin@@ ed with the bel@@ ief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hop@@ e of succ@@ ess .
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an ep@@ ic w@@ in is pos@@ sible , and that it &apos;s always wor@@ th trying , and trying now .
G@@ am@@ ers don &apos;t s@@ it around .
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at we@@ a@@ ving a ti@@ ght soc@@ ial f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch that sho@@ ws we like people better after we pla@@ y a ga@@ me with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ ad@@ ly .
And the reas@@ on is , it ta@@ kes a lot of tru@@ st to pla@@ y a ga@@ me with some@@ one .
We tru@@ st that they will sp@@ end their time with us , that they will pla@@ y by the same ru@@ les , val@@ ue the same go@@ al , sta@@ y with the ga@@ me un@@ ti@@ l it &apos;s over .
And so , pla@@ ying a ga@@ me together actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tru@@ st and c@@ oo@@ per@@ ation .
And we actually buil@@ d str@@ on@@ ger soc@@ ial rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps as a resul@@ t .
B@@ li@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ v@@ ity . I love it .
You know , there &apos;s a reas@@ on why the a@@ ver@@ age W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s a we@@ ek -- kind of a hal@@ f@@ -@@ time jo@@ b .
It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re pla@@ ying a ga@@ me , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rel@@ a@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
We know that we are op@@ ti@@ mi@@ z@@ ed as human be@@ ings , to do hard and me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful work .
And g@@ am@@ ers are wil@@ ling to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re gi@@ ven the right work .
F@@ in@@ ally : ep@@ ic me@@ an@@ ing .
G@@ am@@ ers love to be at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing mis@@ si@@ ons to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ sc@@ ale stor@@ ies .
So , just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that hel@@ ps put that into per@@ spec@@ tive :
So , you all know W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia , bi@@ g@@ ge@@ st wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
S@@ ec@@ ond bi@@ g@@ ge@@ st wi@@ k@@ i in the world , with ne@@ ar@@ ly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 ar@@ tic@@ les , is the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft wi@@ k@@ i .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every m@@ ont@@ h .
They have comp@@ i@@ led more inform@@ ation about W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft on the In@@ ter@@ net than any other t@@ op@@ ic c@@ over@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
They are building an ep@@ ic story .
They are building an ep@@ ic kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge res@@ our@@ ce about the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft .
Ok@@ ay , so these are four su@@ per@@ po@@ wer@@ s that ad@@ d up to one thing :
G@@ am@@ ers are su@@ per@@ -@@ em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed hop@@ ef@@ u@@ l indivi@@ du@@ als .
These are people who believe that they are indivi@@ du@@ ally cap@@ able of chan@@ ging the world .
And the only problem is , they believe that they are cap@@ able of chan@@ ging vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
There &apos;s an econom@@ ist nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ ward C@@ a@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ v@@ a .
H@@ is work is br@@ il@@ li@@ ant . He loo@@ ks at why people are in@@ ve@@ st@@ ing so much time and energy and money in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re wit@@ ne@@ ss@@ ing what am@@ oun@@ ts to no less than a ma@@ ss ex@@ o@@ dus to vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds and on@@ line ga@@ me en@@ vir@@ on@@ ments . &quot;
And he &apos;s an econom@@ ist , so he &apos;s r@@ ational .
And he says -- No@@ t like me , I &apos;m a ga@@ me desig@@ ner ; I &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
But he says that this ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sense , because g@@ am@@ ers can ach@@ ieve more in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds than they can in real life .
They can have str@@ on@@ ger soc@@ ial rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps in g@@ am@@ es than they can have in real life ;
they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in g@@ am@@ es than they do in real life .
So he says , for now it ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sense for g@@ am@@ ers to sp@@ end more time in vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds than the real world .
Now , I also a@@ gre@@ e that that is r@@ ational , for now .
But it is not , by any me@@ ans , an op@@ ti@@ m@@ al s@@ itu@@ ation .
We have to start making the real world work more like a ga@@ me .
I take my in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 years ago .
These are an@@ ci@@ ent di@@ ce , made out of s@@ he@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les .
B@@ ef@@ ore we had a@@ we@@ some ga@@ me contro@@ l@@ l@@ ers , we had s@@ he@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les .
And these re@@ pres@@ ent the first ga@@ me e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment desig@@ ned by human be@@ ings ,
and if you &apos;re fam@@ ili@@ ar with the work of the an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ ree@@ k hi@@ stor@@ i@@ an H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , you might know this hi@@ story ,
which is the hi@@ story of who in@@ ven@@ ted g@@ am@@ es and why .
H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us says that g@@ am@@ es , parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es , were in@@ ven@@ ted in the k@@ ing@@ d@@ om of L@@ y@@ dia , d@@ ur@@ ing a time of fam@@ ine .
A@@ p@@ par@@ en@@ tly , there was s@@ uch a se@@ ver@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ dia de@@ c@@ ide@@ d they had to do something c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
P@@ e@@ ople were su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing . P@@ e@@ ople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
It was an ex@@ tre@@ me s@@ itu@@ ation , they ne@@ e@@ ded an ex@@ tre@@ me solu@@ tion .
So , ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , they in@@ ven@@ ted di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es , and they set up a k@@ ing@@ d@@ om@@ -@@ wi@@ de po@@ lic@@ y :
O@@ n one day , every@@ body would e@@ at ,
and on the next day , every@@ body would pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es .
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed in pla@@ ying the di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es , because g@@ am@@ es are so en@@ ga@@ ging , and im@@ mer@@ se us in s@@ uch s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying , b@@ li@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , they would ig@@ nor@@ e the fact that they had no food to e@@ at .
And then on the next day , they would pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es ;
and on the next day , they would e@@ at .
And ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , they pas@@ s@@ ed 1@@ 8 years this way ,
sur@@ vi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine , by e@@ ating on one day , and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es on the next .
Now , this is ex@@ ac@@ tly , I think , how we &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es today . We &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es to e@@ sc@@ ap@@ e real@@ -@@ world su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing --
we &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es to get away
from everything that &apos;s bro@@ ken in the real en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment , everything that &apos;s not s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from g@@ am@@ es .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
This is really ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing .
A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine wa@@ sn &apos;t getting better ,
so the king de@@ c@@ ide@@ d they would pla@@ y one fin@@ al di@@ ce ga@@ me .
They divi@@ ded the enti@@ re k@@ ing@@ d@@ om in half .
They pla@@ y@@ ed one di@@ ce ga@@ me , and the win@@ n@@ ers of that ga@@ me got to go on an ep@@ ic ad@@ ven@@ ture .
They would lea@@ ve L@@ y@@ dia , and they would go out in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new place to live ,
lea@@ ving be@@ h@@ ind just enough people to sur@@ vi@@ ve on the res@@ our@@ ces that were a@@ va@@ il@@ able , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly to take their ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation some@@ where el@@ se where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
Now , this s@@ oun@@ ds c@@ ra@@ z@@ y , right ?
But rec@@ en@@ tly , D@@ N@@ A e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tru@@ sc@@ ans , who then led to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ mp@@ ire , actually sh@@ are the same D@@ N@@ A as the an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ ans .
And so , rec@@ en@@ tly , sci@@ enti@@ sts have su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ed that H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us &apos; c@@ ra@@ z@@ y story is actually tru@@ e .
And ge@@ olo@@ gi@@ sts have found e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of a glob@@ al c@@ oo@@ ling that la@@ st@@ ed for ne@@ ar@@ ly 20 years , that could have ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed the fam@@ ine .
So this c@@ ra@@ z@@ y story might be tru@@ e .
They might have actually sa@@ ved their cul@@ ture by pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , e@@ sc@@ ap@@ ing to g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 years , and then been so in@@ sp@@ i@@ red , and k@@ new so much about how to come together with g@@ am@@ es , that they actually sa@@ ved the enti@@ re ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation that way .
Ok@@ ay , we can do that .
We &apos;ve been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft sin@@ ce 19@@ 9@@ 4 .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y ga@@ me from the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ser@@ ies . That was 1@@ 6 years ago .
They pla@@ y@@ ed di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 years , we &apos;ve been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft for 1@@ 6 years .
I say we are ready for our own ep@@ ic ga@@ me .
Now , they had half the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation go off in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new world ,
so that &apos;s where I get my 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ ek of ga@@ me@@ -@@ pla@@ y from .
L@@ et &apos;s get half of us to a@@ gre@@ e to sp@@ end an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , un@@ ti@@ l we sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world proble@@ ms .
Now , I know you &apos;re as@@ king , &quot; How are we going to sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world proble@@ ms in g@@ am@@ es ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the pa@@ st few years , at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture .
We have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ic@@ es in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , and it ex@@ pre@@ ss@@ es our vie@@ w of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the fu@@ ture .
We do not want to try to pre@@ dic@@ t the fu@@ ture .
What we want to do is make the fu@@ ture .
We want to ima@@ g@@ ine the be@@ st@@ -@@ ca@@ se sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o out@@ come ,
and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a real@@ ity .
We want to ima@@ g@@ ine ep@@ ic win@@ s , and then give people the me@@ ans to ach@@ ieve the ep@@ ic w@@ in .
I &apos;m just going to very br@@ ie@@ f@@ ly show you three g@@ am@@ es that I &apos;ve made that are an at@@ te@@ mp@@ t to give people the me@@ ans to create ep@@ ic win@@ s in their own fu@@ tu@@ res .
This is W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ th@@ out O@@ il .
We made this ga@@ me in 200@@ 7 .
This is an on@@ line ga@@ me in which you try to sur@@ vi@@ ve an o@@ il sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge .
The o@@ il sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge is fic@@ tion@@ al , but we put enough on@@ line cont@@ ent out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve ru@@ n out of o@@ il . So when you come to the ga@@ me , you sig@@ n up , tell us where you live ,
and then we give you real@@ -@@ time ne@@ ws vide@@ o@@ s , data fe@@ eds that show you ex@@ ac@@ tly how much o@@ il co@@ sts , what &apos;s not a@@ va@@ il@@ able , how food su@@ pp@@ ly is being a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ted , how tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation is being a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ted , if sch@@ oo@@ ls are c@@ los@@ ed , if there &apos;s ri@@ ot@@ ing ,
and you have to fig@@ ure out how you would live your real life as if this were tru@@ e . And then we as@@ k you to b@@ lo@@ g about it , to p@@ ost vide@@ o@@ s , to p@@ ost ph@@ oto@@ s .
We p@@ il@@ ot@@ ed this ga@@ me with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 pla@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 7 ,
and we &apos;ve tr@@ ac@@ ked them for the three years sin@@ ce .
And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ form@@ ative experi@@ ence .
No@@ body wan@@ ts to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to .
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an ep@@ ic ad@@ ven@@ ture and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve ru@@ n out of o@@ il .
This is an a@@ ma@@ zing story and ad@@ ven@@ ture for you to go on .
Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge y@@ our@@ self to see how you would sur@@ vi@@ ve , &quot;
most of our pla@@ y@@ ers have ke@@ pt up the ha@@ b@@ its that they lear@@ ned in this ga@@ me .
So for the next wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ sa@@ ving ga@@ me , we de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to a@@ i@@ m hi@@ gh@@ er -- bi@@ g@@ ger problem than just pe@@ a@@ k o@@ il .
We did a ga@@ me called S@@ u@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture .
And the pre@@ mi@@ se was , a su@@ per@@ computer has c@@ al@@ cul@@ ated that hu@@ man@@ s have only 2@@ 3 years le@@ ft on the plan@@ et .
This su@@ per@@ computer was called the G@@ lob@@ al E@@ x@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess S@@ y@@ ste@@ m , of course .
We as@@ ked people to come on@@ line -- al@@ most like a J@@ er@@ ry B@@ ru@@ c@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mo@@ v@@ ie .
You know J@@ er@@ ry B@@ ru@@ c@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mo@@ v@@ ies , you form a dre@@ am te@@ am --
you &apos;ve got the a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ ut , the sci@@ enti@@ st , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ v@@ ic@@ t , and they all have something to do to sa@@ ve the world .
But in our ga@@ me , in@@ ste@@ ad of just ha@@ ving five people on the dre@@ am te@@ am , we said , &quot; E@@ very@@ body &apos;s on the dre@@ am te@@ am , and it &apos;s your jo@@ b to in@@ v@@ ent the fu@@ ture of energy , the fu@@ ture of food , the fu@@ ture of heal@@ th , the fu@@ ture of sec@@ ur@@ ity and the fu@@ ture of the soc@@ ial sa@@ fe@@ ty net . &quot;
We had 8@@ ,000 people pla@@ y that ga@@ me for ei@@ ght we@@ e@@ ks .
They came up with 5@@ 00 in@@ s@@ an@@ ely cre@@ ative solu@@ tions that you can go on@@ line , G@@ oog@@ le &quot; S@@ u@@ per@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
So , fin@@ ally , the last ga@@ me , we &apos;re la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing it M@@ ar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . This is a ga@@ me done with the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te .
If you comple@@ te the ga@@ me , you will be cer@@ ti@@ f@@ ied by the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te as a S@@ oc@@ ial In@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ or , c@@ la@@ ss of 20@@ 10 .
W@@ or@@ king with uni@@ vers@@ ities all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa , and we are in@@ v@@ it@@ ing them to lear@@ n soc@@ ial in@@ no@@ v@@ ation sk@@ il@@ ls .
We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hi@@ c no@@ v@@ el , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ il@@ ls like loc@@ al in@@ si@@ ght , kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge net@@ working , su@@ sta@@ in@@ abil@@ ity , vi@@ sion and res@@ our@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ne@@ ss .
I would like to in@@ v@@ ite all of you to p@@ lea@@ se sh@@ are this ga@@ me with y@@ oun@@ g people , any@@ where in the world , parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly in develop@@ ing are@@ as , who might ben@@ ef@@ it from coming together to try to start to ima@@ g@@ ine their own soc@@ ial en@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses to sa@@ ve the world .
So , I &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
I want to as@@ k a question .
What do you think happ@@ ens next ?
We &apos;ve got all these a@@ ma@@ zing g@@ am@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these g@@ am@@ es that are kind of p@@ il@@ ots of what we might do , but n@@ one of them have sa@@ ved the real world y@@ et .
Well I hop@@ e you will a@@ gre@@ e with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human res@@ our@@ ce that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work , that g@@ am@@ es are a po@@ wer@@ ful pl@@ at@@ form for change .
We have all these a@@ ma@@ zing su@@ per@@ po@@ wer@@ s : b@@ li@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , the abil@@ ity to we@@ a@@ ve a ti@@ ght soc@@ ial f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , this fe@@ el@@ ing of ur@@ gen@@ t op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and the de@@ si@@ re for ep@@ ic me@@ an@@ ing .
I really hop@@ e that we can come together to pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es that mat@@ ter , to sur@@ vi@@ ve on this plan@@ et for another cen@@ tur@@ y .
That &apos;s my hop@@ e , that you will jo@@ in me in making and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es like this .
When I look for@@ ward to the next de@@ ca@@ de , I know two things for s@@ ure : that we can make any fu@@ ture we can ima@@ g@@ ine , and we can pla@@ y any g@@ am@@ es we want , so I say :
L@@ et the wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ chan@@ ging g@@ am@@ es begin .
Thank you .
F@@ or some time I have been interest@@ ed in the pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect ,
which might se@@ em like an o@@ d@@ d thing for a ma@@ g@@ ici@@ an to be interest@@ ed in , un@@ less you think of it in the ter@@ ms that I do , which is , &quot; S@@ ome@@ thing fa@@ ke is bel@@ ie@@ ved in enough by some@@ body that it be@@ comes something real . &quot; In other wor@@ ds , su@@ ga@@ r p@@ il@@ ls have a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in cer@@ ta@@ in kin@@ ds of stu@@ di@@ es , the pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect ,
just because the person thin@@ ks that what &apos;s happen@@ ing to them is a ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al or some sort of a --
for pa@@ in man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment , for example , if they believe it enough there is a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in the body called the pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect .
S@@ ome@@ thing fa@@ ke be@@ comes something real because of some@@ one &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tion of it .
In or@@ der for us to understand each other , I want to start by sho@@ wing you a ru@@ di@@ men@@ t@@ ary , very simp@@ le ma@@ gi@@ c tr@@ ick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it wor@@ ks . This is a tr@@ ick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s ma@@ gi@@ c b@@ ook sin@@ ce at lea@@ st the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s .
I lear@@ ned it my@@ self from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out Ma@@ gi@@ c in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll ex@@ pla@@ in it .
And then I &apos;ll ex@@ pla@@ in why I ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed it .
So , here &apos;s what happ@@ ens .
The k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
I &apos;m just going to h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe in my fi@@ st like this .
I &apos;ll get my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
And to make s@@ ure no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve I &apos;m just going to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here .
That way you can see that at no time
can any@@ thing tra@@ v@@ el , as long as I &apos;m s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ zing there no@@ thing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve .
And the ob@@ ject of this is quite simp@@ le .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , if all is well , my p@@ ure anim@@ al ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m will h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe .
In fact it &apos;s h@@ eld so ti@@ gh@@ tly in place that I can s@@ ha@@ ke it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
No@@ thing go@@ es up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , no tr@@ ic@@ ker@@ y . And you can exam@@ ine everything .
T@@ a@@ -@@ d@@ a !
So , this is a tr@@ ick that I of@@ ten te@@ ach to y@@ oun@@ g children that are interest@@ ed in ma@@ gi@@ c , because you can lear@@ n a great de@@ al about de@@ cep@@ tion by stu@@ d@@ ying
this very -- even thou@@ gh it &apos;s a very simp@@ le tr@@ ick me@@ th@@ o@@ dol@@ og@@ ically .
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably many of you in the r@@ oom know this tr@@ ick .
What happ@@ ens is this .
I h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand .
I say I &apos;m going to gra@@ b h@@ old of my w@@ ri@@ st to make s@@ ure no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve ,
that is a lie .
The reas@@ on I &apos;m h@@ ol@@ ding on@@ to my w@@ ri@@ st is because that &apos;s actually the sec@@ r@@ et of the il@@ lu@@ sion .
In a moment when my hand mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you , this f@@ ing@@ er right here , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is , to a pos@@ it@@ ion
po@@ in@@ ting out like this . N@@ ice one . S@@ ome@@ one who didn &apos;t have a chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood is out there .
So , it go@@ es like this , from here , right .
And as I mo@@ ve around my f@@ ing@@ er shi@@ f@@ ts .
And we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t not@@ ice there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here ,
because the m@@ ind , and the way it proc@@ ess@@ es inform@@ ation , it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t , one , two , three . It gr@@ ou@@ ps them .
But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Ri@@ ght ? And then I open my hand up .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly it &apos;s cl@@ ing@@ ing there , not by anim@@ al ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er being there .
And then when I cl@@ ose my f@@ ing@@ er , same thing ,
as I mo@@ ve back , this mot@@ ion kind of c@@ over@@ s the mo@@ ving back of my f@@ ing@@ er .
I take this hand away . You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
There is a tr@@ ick you can do for your fri@@ en@@ ds and ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ s . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Now , what does that have to do with the pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect ?
I re@@ ad a stu@@ dy a year or so ago that really b@@ le@@ w my m@@ ind wi@@ de open .
I &apos;m not a do@@ c@@ tor or a re@@ se@@ arch@@ er , so this , to me , was an a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing thing .
It tur@@ ns out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o in the form of a wh@@ ite p@@ ill , that &apos;s like a@@ sp@@ ir@@ in sh@@ ap@@ ed -- it &apos;s just a r@@ ound wh@@ ite p@@ ill -- it has some cer@@ ta@@ in me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect .
But if you change the form that you give the pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o in , like you make a sm@@ all@@ er p@@ ill , and col@@ or it bl@@ ue , and st@@ am@@ p a let@@ ter into it , it is actually me@@ as@@ ur@@ ably more eff@@ ec@@ tive .
E@@ ven thou@@ gh ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al -- they &apos;re su@@ ga@@ r p@@ il@@ ls .
But a wh@@ ite p@@ ill is not as good as a bl@@ ue p@@ ill .
What ? That really f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed me out .
T@@ ur@@ ns out thou@@ gh , that that &apos;s not even where it stop@@ s .
If you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more eff@@ ec@@ tive than t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts in any form .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a wh@@ ite cap@@ su@@ le .
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this .
One p@@ ill tw@@ ice a day is not as good at three p@@ il@@ ls -- I don &apos;t re@@ me@@ mber the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic now . S@@ or@@ ry .
But the point is ...
... these d@@ os@@ a@@ ges have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
And if you want the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate in pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o , you &apos;ve go to the ne@@ ed@@ le .
Ri@@ ght ? A sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge with some in@@ ert -- a cou@@ ple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert something , and you in@@ ject this into a p@@ ati@@ ent ...
Well this is s@@ uch a po@@ wer@@ ful ima@@ ge in their m@@ ind ,
it &apos;s so much str@@ on@@ ger than the wh@@ ite p@@ ill .
It &apos;s a really , this grap@@ h , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
The point is the wh@@ ite p@@ ill is not as good as the bl@@ ue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the ne@@ ed@@ le .
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ al qu@@ al@@ ity ,
it &apos;s only your bel@@ ief that ma@@ kes it real in your body and ma@@ kes a str@@ on@@ ger eff@@ ect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and app@@ ly it to a ma@@ gi@@ c tr@@ ick .
And take something that is ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly a fa@@ ke tr@@ ick and make it se@@ em real .
And we know from that stu@@ dy that when you want real@@ ity , you go to the ne@@ ed@@ le .
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in . It &apos;s very , very sh@@ ar@@ p ,
and I &apos;m going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a t@@ in@@ y bit .
This is really my f@@ le@@ sh . This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an &apos;s speci@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn f@@ le@@ sh .
That &apos;s my sk@@ in right there . This is not a H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood spec@@ ial eff@@ ect .
I &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my sk@@ in and ru@@ n this ne@@ ed@@ le through to the other side .
If you &apos;re qu@@ e@@ as@@ y -- if you fa@@ int e@@ as@@ ily -- I was doing this for some fri@@ en@@ ds in the h@@ ot@@ el r@@ oom last ni@@ ght , and some people that I didn &apos;t know ,
and one w@@ om@@ an al@@ most pas@@ s@@ ed out .
So , I su@@ g@@ ge@@ st if you get qu@@ e@@ as@@ y e@@ as@@ y that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first b@@ ad part be@@ h@@ ind it .
You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
So , here is what happ@@ ens , right here ,
the begin@@ ning of my f@@ le@@ sh at the lo@@ wer part of my ar@@ m I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry , man . A@@ m I f@@ re@@ a@@ king you out ?
OK , and then just through my sk@@ in a t@@ in@@ y bit , and then out the other side like this .
Now , es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally we &apos;re in the same pos@@ it@@ ion we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tr@@ ick .
S@@ ort of .
But you can &apos;t coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
Y@@ es , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
They go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly not du@@ m@@ b enough to sta@@ b hi@@ m@@ self through the sk@@ in to en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in us for a few minu@@ tes . So , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
How &apos;s that look out there ? P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good .
Y@@ ea@@ h , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot; P@@ e@@ ople in the s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ e r@@ oom are star@@ ting to mo@@ ve in now .
L@@ et me give you good cl@@ ose look at this .
That really is my sk@@ in . That is not a H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood spec@@ ial eff@@ ect .
That &apos;s my f@@ le@@ sh , and I can t@@ wi@@ st that around .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry . If you &apos;re getting qu@@ e@@ as@@ y , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
P@@ e@@ ople in the back or people on vide@@ o years from now wat@@ ch@@ ing this will go , &quot; Well ye@@ a@@ h , that loo@@ ks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of eff@@ ect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole there , if it were real he would be b@@ le@@ e@@ ding . Well let me work up some bl@@ ood for you .
Y@@ es , there it is .
N@@ or@@ m@@ ally now , I would take the ne@@ ed@@ le out .
I would c@@ le@@ an off my ar@@ m , and I would show you that there are no w@@ oun@@ ds .
But I think in this con@@ te@@ xt and with the idea of ta@@ king something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to lea@@ ve it there , and w@@ alk off the sta@@ ge .
I will be se@@ e@@ ing you se@@ ver@@ al times over the next few da@@ ys .
I hop@@ e you &apos;re looking for@@ ward to that . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ve kno@@ wn a lot of f@@ ish in my life .
I &apos;ve lo@@ ved only two .
That first one , it was more like a pas@@ sion@@ ate a@@ ff@@ a@@ ir .
It was a beau@@ ti@@ ful f@@ ish : f@@ la@@ vor@@ ful , te@@ x@@ tu@@ red , me@@ at@@ y , a be@@ st@@ sel@@ l@@ er on the men@@ u .
What a f@@ ish .
E@@ ven better , it was f@@ ar@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed hi@@ g@@ he@@ st stand@@ ar@@ ds of su@@ sta@@ in@@ abil@@ ity .
So you could feel good about sel@@ ling it .
I was in a rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this beau@@ ty for se@@ ver@@ al mon@@ th@@ s .
One day , the he@@ ad of the comp@@ any called and as@@ ked if I &apos;d sp@@ ea@@ k at an e@@ v@@ ent about the f@@ ar@@ m &apos;s su@@ sta@@ in@@ abil@@ ity .
&quot; A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely , &quot; I said .
Here was a comp@@ any trying to sol@@ ve what &apos;s be@@ come this uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able problem for us ch@@ ef@@ s :
How do we ke@@ ep f@@ ish on our men@@ us ?
F@@ or the pa@@ st 50 years , we &apos;ve been f@@ is@@ h@@ ing the se@@ as like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ c@@ ut for@@ est@@ s .
It &apos;s hard to over@@ st@@ ate the de@@ struc@@ tion .
N@@ in@@ e@@ ty percent of lar@@ ge f@@ ish , the ones we love -- the t@@ un@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the s@@ al@@ m@@ ons , s@@ wor@@ d@@ f@@ ish -- they &apos;ve col@@ l@@ ap@@ s@@ ed .
There &apos;s al@@ most no@@ thing le@@ ft .
So , for better or for wor@@ se , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ ming , is going to be a part of our fu@@ ture .
A lot of ar@@ gu@@ ments aga@@ in@@ st it :
F@@ ish f@@ ar@@ ms pol@@ lu@@ te -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they &apos;re in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent . T@@ a@@ ke t@@ un@@ a ,
a ma@@ j@@ or dra@@ w@@ back .
It &apos;s got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 1@@ 5 to one .
That me@@ ans it ta@@ kes fi@@ f@@ t@@ een p@@ oun@@ ds of wil@@ d f@@ ish to get you one p@@ ound of f@@ ar@@ m t@@ un@@ a .
No@@ t very su@@ sta@@ in@@ able .
It doesn &apos;t ta@@ ste very good ei@@ ther .
So here , fin@@ ally , was a comp@@ any trying to do it right .
I wanted to su@@ p@@ por@@ t them .
The day before the e@@ v@@ ent , I called the he@@ ad of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the comp@@ any .
L@@ et &apos;s call him D@@ on .
&quot; D@@ on , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the fac@@ ts stra@@ i@@ ght , you gu@@ ys are fam@@ ous for f@@ ar@@ ming so f@@ ar out to se@@ a , you don &apos;t pol@@ lu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so f@@ ar out , the wa@@ ste from our f@@ ish ge@@ ts di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted , not con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ated . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; We &apos;re bas@@ ically a world un@@ to our@@ selves .
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said . &quot; B@@ est in the bu@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
2@@ .@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2@@ .@@ 5 what ? What are you fe@@ e@@ ding ? &quot;
&quot; S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s , &quot; he said .
&quot; G@@ re@@ at , &quot; I said . G@@ o@@ t off the ph@@ one .
And that ni@@ ght , I was l@@ ying in be@@ d , and I thought : What the hel@@ l is a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ e@@ in ?
So the next day , just before the e@@ v@@ ent , I called D@@ on .
I said , &quot; D@@ on , what are some exam@@ p@@ les of su@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know . He would as@@ k around .
Well , I got on the ph@@ one with a few people in the comp@@ any ;
no one could give me a stra@@ i@@ ght ans@@ wer
un@@ ti@@ l fin@@ ally , I got on the ph@@ one with the he@@ ad bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ st .
L@@ et &apos;s call him D@@ on too .
&quot; D@@ on , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some exam@@ p@@ les of su@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s ? &quot;
Well , he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some f@@ ish me@@ als , and then he said ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts .
I said , &quot; Ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , fe@@ a@@ th@@ ers , sk@@ in , b@@ one me@@ al , sc@@ r@@ ap@@ s , dr@@ ied and proc@@ ess@@ ed into fe@@ ed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ic@@ ken ? &quot;
Th@@ in@@ king , you know , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; D@@ on , what &apos;s su@@ sta@@ in@@ able about fe@@ e@@ ding ch@@ ic@@ ken to f@@ ish ? &quot;
There was a long p@@ ause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much ch@@ ic@@ ken in the world . &quot;
I f@@ ell out of love with this f@@ ish .
No , not because I &apos;m some sel@@ f@@ -@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , g@@ oo@@ d@@ y@@ -@@ two sho@@ es f@@ oo@@ die .
I actually am .
No , I actually f@@ ell out of love with this f@@ ish because , I s@@ we@@ ar to God , after that con@@ vers@@ ation , the f@@ ish tast@@ ed like ch@@ ic@@ ken .
This second f@@ ish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
It &apos;s the r@@ om@@ an@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your f@@ ish , you love the f@@ ish .
I first ate it at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in .
A j@@ our@@ n@@ ali@@ st fri@@ end had been tal@@ king about this f@@ ish for a long time .
S@@ he kind of set us up .
It came to the t@@ able a b@@ right , al@@ most shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing , wh@@ ite col@@ or .
The ch@@ e@@ f had over@@ c@@ oo@@ ked it .
L@@ i@@ ke tw@@ ice over .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly , it was still del@@ ici@@ ous .
Wh@@ o can make a f@@ ish ta@@ ste good after it &apos;s been over@@ c@@ oo@@ ked ?
I can &apos;t , but this gu@@ y can .
L@@ et &apos;s call him M@@ ig@@ u@@ el --
actually his na@@ me is M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
And no , he didn &apos;t c@@ ook the f@@ ish , and he &apos;s not a ch@@ e@@ f ,
at lea@@ st in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ st at V@@ et@@ a L@@ a P@@ al@@ ma .
It &apos;s a f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n cor@@ ner of S@@ pa@@ in .
It &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver .
U@@ n@@ ti@@ l the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , the f@@ ar@@ m was in the hand@@ s of the A@@ r@@ gen@@ t@@ in@@ i@@ ans .
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f c@@ at@@ tle on what was es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally we@@ t@@ land@@ s .
They did it by dra@@ in@@ ing the land .
They buil@@ t this in@@ tr@@ ic@@ ate ser@@ ies of c@@ an@@ als , and they p@@ us@@ he@@ d water off the land and out into the ri@@ ver .
Well , they cou@@ ldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
And ec@@ olog@@ ically , it was a di@@ sa@@ ster .
It kil@@ led like 9@@ 0 percent of the b@@ ir@@ ds ,
which , for this place , is a lot of b@@ ir@@ ds .
And so in 19@@ 8@@ 2 , a S@@ p@@ an@@ ish comp@@ any with an en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ tal con@@ sci@@ ence p@@ ur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the land .
What did they do ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of water .
They lit@@ er@@ ally f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed the s@@ wit@@ ch .
In@@ ste@@ ad of pu@@ sh@@ ing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to p@@ ul@@ l water back in .
They f@@ loo@@ ded the c@@ an@@ als .
They cre@@ ated a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m -- bas@@ s , m@@ ul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , eel -- and in the proc@@ ess , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el and this comp@@ any comple@@ tely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ olog@@ ical de@@ struc@@ tion .
The f@@ ar@@ m &apos;s incre@@ di@@ ble .
I mean , you &apos;ve never s@@ een any@@ thing like this .
You st@@ are out at a h@@ or@@ iz@@ on that is a million mi@@ les away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded c@@ an@@ als and this th@@ ick , r@@ ich mar@@ sh@@ land .
I was there not long ago with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
He &apos;s an a@@ ma@@ zing gu@@ y , like three par@@ ts Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e .
Ok@@ ay ? There we are s@@ log@@ ging through the we@@ t@@ land@@ s , and I &apos;m p@@ an@@ ting and s@@ we@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and M@@ ig@@ u@@ el &apos;s c@@ al@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a bi@@ olog@@ y lec@@ ture .
Here , he &apos;s po@@ in@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ ed K@@ ite .
Now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al ne@@ eds of ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
And here , here he se@@ es a gr@@ ou@@ p@@ ing pat@@ ter@@ n that re@@ min@@ ds him of the T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ an G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
It tur@@ ns out , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el sp@@ ent the better part of his car@@ e@@ er in the M@@ ik@@ u@@ m@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k in Africa .
I as@@ ked him how he bec@@ a@@ me s@@ uch an ex@@ per@@ t on f@@ ish .
He said , &quot; F@@ ish ? I didn &apos;t know any@@ thing about f@@ ish .
I &apos;m an ex@@ per@@ t in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps . &quot;
And then he &apos;s off , la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing into more talk about r@@ are b@@ ir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and str@@ an@@ ge a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c plan@@ ts .
And don &apos;t get me wr@@ ong , that was really f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating , you know , the bi@@ ot@@ ic commun@@ ity un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ ged , kind of thing .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my he@@ ad was s@@ w@@ oon@@ ing over that over@@ c@@ oo@@ ked pie@@ ce of del@@ ici@@ ous f@@ ish I had the ni@@ ght before .
So I inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted him . I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , what ma@@ kes your f@@ ish ta@@ ste so good ? &quot;
He po@@ in@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; I know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps : It &apos;s a@@ ma@@ zing .
But what are your f@@ ish e@@ ating ?
What &apos;s the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o ? &quot;
Well , he go@@ es on to tell me it &apos;s s@@ uch a r@@ ich system that the f@@ ish are e@@ ating what they &apos;d be e@@ ating in the wil@@ d .
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s , the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the z@@ oo@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ eds the f@@ ish .
The system is so heal@@ th@@ y , it &apos;s tot@@ ally sel@@ f@@ -@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
There is no fe@@ ed .
E@@ ver he@@ ard of a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its anim@@ als ?
L@@ ater that day , I was dri@@ ving around this pro@@ per@@ ty with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and I as@@ ked him , I said , &quot; F@@ or a place that se@@ em@@ s so nat@@ ur@@ al , un@@ like like any f@@ ar@@ m I &apos;d ever been at , how do you me@@ as@@ ure succ@@ ess ? &quot;
A@@ t that moment , it was as if a film direc@@ tor called for a set change .
And we r@@ oun@@ ded the cor@@ ner and sa@@ w the most a@@ ma@@ zing si@@ ght : thou@@ s@@ and@@ s and thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of p@@ in@@ k f@@ la@@ min@@ go@@ s , a lit@@ er@@ al p@@ in@@ k car@@ p@@ et for as f@@ ar as you could see .
&quot; That &apos;s succ@@ ess , &quot; he said .
&quot; L@@ ook at their bel@@ l@@ ies , p@@ in@@ k .
They &apos;re fe@@ a@@ st@@ ing . &quot;
F@@ ea@@ st@@ ing ? I was tot@@ ally conf@@ used .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ a@@ st@@ ing on your f@@ ish ? &quot;
&quot; Y@@ es , &quot; he said .
&quot; We l@@ ose 20 percent of our f@@ ish and f@@ ish eg@@ gs to b@@ ir@@ ds .
Well , last year , this pro@@ per@@ ty had 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 b@@ ir@@ ds on it , more than 2@@ 50 different spec@@ ies .
It &apos;s be@@ come , today , the lar@@ ge@@ st and one of the most important pri@@ v@@ ate b@@ ir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of E@@ uro@@ p@@ e . &quot;
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , is@@ n &apos;t a th@@ ri@@ ving b@@ ir@@ d pop@@ ul@@ ation like the last thing you want on a f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m ? &quot;
He sh@@ ook his he@@ ad , no .
He said , &quot; We f@@ ar@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y , not in@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y .
This is an ec@@ olog@@ ical net@@ work .
The f@@ la@@ min@@ go@@ s e@@ at the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p e@@ at the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
So the p@@ in@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
Ok@@ ay , so let &apos;s re@@ vie@@ w :
a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its anim@@ als , and a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess on the heal@@ th of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
A f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m , but also a b@@ ir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
Oh , and by the way , those f@@ la@@ min@@ go@@ s , they sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They br@@ ood in a to@@ wn 1@@ 50 mi@@ les away , where the s@@ o@@ il con@@ di@@ tions are better for building ne@@ sts .
E@@ very mor@@ ning , they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les into the f@@ ar@@ m .
And every e@@ ven@@ ing , they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les back .
They do that because they &apos;re able to f@@ ol@@ low the bro@@ ken wh@@ ite line of hi@@ gh@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2 .
No k@@ id@@ ding .
I was ima@@ gin@@ ing a &quot; M@@ ar@@ ch of the P@@ en@@ gu@@ ins &quot; thing , so I loo@@ ked at M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les to the f@@ ar@@ m , and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les back at ni@@ ght ?
D@@ o they do that for the children ? &quot;
He loo@@ ked at me like I had just quot@@ ed a Wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y H@@ ou@@ st@@ on s@@ ong .
He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ o@@ ved f@@ ish , which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don &apos;t like f@@ ish sk@@ in ;
I don &apos;t like it se@@ ar@@ ed , I don &apos;t like it c@@ ri@@ sp@@ y .
It &apos;s that ac@@ ri@@ d , t@@ ar@@ -@@ like f@@ la@@ v@@ or .
I al@@ most never c@@ ook with it .
Y@@ et , when I tast@@ ed it at that re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in , it tast@@ ed not at all like f@@ ish sk@@ in .
It tast@@ ed s@@ weet and c@@ le@@ an , like you were ta@@ king a b@@ ite of the oce@@ an .
I men@@ tion@@ ed that to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
He said , &quot; The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ on@@ ge .
It &apos;s the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se before any@@ thing en@@ ters the body .
It e@@ vol@@ ved to s@@ o@@ a@@ k up imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; But our water has no imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
OK . A f@@ ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its f@@ ish ,
a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess by the succ@@ ess of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
And then I real@@ ized when he says , &quot; A f@@ ar@@ m that has no imp@@ ur@@ ities , &quot; he made a big under@@ st@@ at@@ e@@ ment , because the water that f@@ lo@@ ws through that f@@ ar@@ m comes in from the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver .
It &apos;s a ri@@ ver that car@@ r@@ ies with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s t@@ end to car@@ ry these da@@ ys : ch@@ em@@ ical cont@@ am@@ in@@ an@@ ts , pe@@ st@@ ici@@ de ru@@ no@@ ff .
And when it wor@@ ks its way through the system and lea@@ ves , the water is c@@ le@@ an@@ er than when it en@@ ter@@ ed .
The system is so heal@@ th@@ y , it p@@ ur@@ i@@ f@@ ies the water .
So , not just a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its anim@@ als , not just a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess by the heal@@ th of its pre@@ dat@@ ors , but a f@@ ar@@ m that &apos;s lit@@ er@@ ally a water p@@ ur@@ i@@ fic@@ ation pl@@ ant --
and not just for those f@@ ish , but for you and me as well .
Because when that water lea@@ ves , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic .
A d@@ ro@@ p in the oce@@ an , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , ho@@ we@@ ver r@@ om@@ an@@ tic , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
You might say it &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for the fu@@ ture of good food , w@@ he@@ ther we &apos;re tal@@ king about bas@@ s or be@@ e@@ f c@@ at@@ tle .
What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new con@@ cep@@ tion of a@@ gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , one in which the food actually tast@@ es good .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too ra@@ dic@@ al .
We &apos;re not real@@ ist@@ s , us f@@ oo@@ di@@ es ;
we &apos;re lo@@ ver@@ s .
We love f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers &apos; mar@@ ke@@ ts ,
we love sm@@ all fam@@ ily f@@ ar@@ ms ,
we talk about loc@@ al food ,
we e@@ at organ@@ ic .
And when you su@@ g@@ ge@@ st these are the things that will en@@ s@@ ure the fu@@ ture of good food , some@@ one , some@@ where stand@@ s up and says , &quot; H@@ ey gu@@ y , I love p@@ in@@ k f@@ la@@ min@@ go@@ s , but how are you going to fe@@ ed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to fe@@ ed the world ?
C@@ an I be h@@ on@@ est ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
No , not because we al@@ ready produc@@ e enough c@@ al@@ or@@ ies to more than fe@@ ed the world .
One bil@@ lion people will go h@@ un@@ gr@@ y today .
One bil@@ lion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gr@@ os@@ s in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ ities in di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion , not ton@@ na@@ ge .
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the lo@@ gi@@ c of our food system for the last 50 years .
F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pe@@ st@@ ic@@ ide@@ s to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tu@@ res , ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als to s@@ o@@ il , ch@@ ic@@ ken to f@@ ish , and all al@@ ong ag@@ ri@@ bu@@ sin@@ ess has simp@@ ly as@@ ked , &quot; If we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding more people more ch@@ e@@ ap@@ ly , how ter@@ ri@@ ble could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the mot@@ i@@ v@@ ation ,
it &apos;s been the ju@@ st@@ i@@ fic@@ ation :
it &apos;s been the bu@@ sin@@ ess pl@@ an of Amer@@ ic@@ an a@@ gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture .
We should call it what it is : a bu@@ sin@@ ess in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation , a bu@@ sin@@ ess that &apos;s qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ olog@@ ical cap@@ it@@ al that ma@@ kes that very produc@@ tion pos@@ sible .
That &apos;s not a bu@@ sin@@ ess , and it is@@ n &apos;t a@@ gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture .
O@@ ur bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ is@@ h@@ ing su@@ pp@@ ly , but because of di@@ min@@ is@@ h@@ ing res@@ our@@ ces . No@@ t by the l@@ at@@ est com@@ b@@ ine and tr@@ ac@@ tor in@@ ven@@ tion , but by f@@ er@@ t@@ ile land ; not by pu@@ mp@@ s , but by f@@ res@@ h water ; not by ch@@ a@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by for@@ est@@ s ; and not by f@@ is@@ h@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and ne@@ ts , but by f@@ ish in the se@@ a .
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the world ?
L@@ et &apos;s start by as@@ king : How are we going to fe@@ ed our@@ selves ?
O@@ r better : How can we create con@@ di@@ tions that en@@ able every commun@@ ity to fe@@ ed it@@ self ?
T@@ o do that , don &apos;t look at the ag@@ ri@@ bu@@ sin@@ ess model for the fu@@ ture .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
It &apos;s hi@@ gh on cap@@ it@@ al , ch@@ e@@ mi@@ str@@ y and mach@@ in@@ es , and it &apos;s never produc@@ ed any@@ thing really good to e@@ at .
In@@ ste@@ ad , let &apos;s look to the ec@@ olog@@ ical model .
That &apos;s the one that rel@@ ies on two bil@@ lion years of on@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ jo@@ b experi@@ ence .
L@@ ook to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers like M@@ ig@@ u@@ el . F@@ ar@@ ms that aren &apos;t wor@@ l@@ ds un@@ to the@@ m@@ selves ; f@@ ar@@ ms that re@@ stor@@ e in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ ple@@ te ; f@@ ar@@ ms that f@@ ar@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y in@@ ste@@ ad of just in@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y ; f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers that are not just produc@@ ers , but ex@@ per@@ ts in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps . Because they &apos;re the ones that are ex@@ per@@ ts in f@@ la@@ v@@ or , too .
And if I &apos;m going to be really h@@ on@@ est , they &apos;re a better ch@@ e@@ f than I &apos;ll ever be .
You know , I &apos;m o@@ k@@ ay with that , because if that &apos;s the fu@@ ture of good food , it &apos;s going to be del@@ ici@@ ous .
Thank you .
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ady di@@ et of sci@@ ence fic@@ tion .
In hi@@ gh school , I took a b@@ us to school an h@@ our each way every day .
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ be@@ d in a b@@ ook , sci@@ ence fic@@ tion b@@ ook , which took my m@@ ind to other wor@@ l@@ ds , and s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied , in a n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative form , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sense of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity that I had .
And you know , that cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity also man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ed it@@ self in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I wa@@ sn &apos;t in school I was out in the w@@ oo@@ ds , hi@@ king and ta@@ king &quot; sa@@ mp@@ les &quot; -- fro@@ gs and s@@ na@@ kes and bu@@ gs and p@@ ond water -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it back , looking at it un@@ der the m@@ ic@@ ros@@ c@@ op@@ e .
You know , I was a real sci@@ ence ge@@ ek .
But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the lim@@ its of pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ity .
And my love of sci@@ ence fic@@ tion actually se@@ em@@ ed m@@ ir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happen@@ ing , this was in the l@@ ate &apos; 6@@ 0@@ s , we were going to the m@@ oon , we were ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the de@@ ep oce@@ ans . J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u was coming into our li@@ ving r@@ oo@@ ms with his a@@ ma@@ zing speci@@ als that sho@@ w@@ ed us anim@@ als and pl@@ ac@@ es and a w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly ima@@ gin@@ ed .
So , that se@@ em@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole sci@@ ence fic@@ tion part of it .
And I was an arti@@ st .
I could dra@@ w . I could pa@@ int .
And I found that because there wer@@ en &apos;t vide@@ o g@@ am@@ es and this s@@ at@@ ur@@ ation of C@@ G mo@@ v@@ ies and all of this ima@@ ger@@ y in the me@@ dia land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , I had to create these ima@@ ges in my he@@ ad .
You know , we all did , as kids ha@@ ving to re@@ ad a b@@ ook , and through the au@@ th@@ or &apos;s de@@ scri@@ p@@ tion , put something on the mo@@ v@@ ie sc@@ re@@ en in our he@@ a@@ ds .
And so , my resp@@ on@@ se to this was to pa@@ int , to dra@@ w al@@ ien cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , al@@ ien wor@@ l@@ ds , ro@@ bot@@ s , sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
I was en@@ d@@ le@@ ss@@ ly getting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h c@@ la@@ ss d@@ oo@@ d@@ ling be@@ h@@ ind the te@@ x@@ t@@ b@@ ook .
That was -- the cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity had to find its out@@ let some@@ how .
And an interesting thing happened : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u sho@@ ws actually got me very ex@@ c@@ ited about the fact that there was an al@@ ien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an al@@ ien world on a sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day --
that se@@ em@@ ed pret@@ ty d@@ ar@@ n un@@ li@@ kel@@ y .
But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as r@@ ich and ex@@ ot@@ ic as any@@ thing that I had ima@@ gin@@ ed from re@@ a@@ ding these boo@@ ks .
So , I de@@ c@@ ide@@ d I was going to be@@ come a sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 1@@ 5 .
And the only problem with that was that I li@@ ved in a little v@@ il@@ la@@ ge in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , 6@@ 00 mi@@ les from the ne@@ ar@@ est oce@@ an .
But I didn &apos;t let that da@@ un@@ t me .
I pe@@ ster@@ ed my fa@@ ther un@@ ti@@ l he fin@@ ally found a sc@@ ub@@ a c@@ la@@ ss in B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New Yor@@ k , right ac@@ ros@@ s the bor@@ der from where we live .
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ f@@ ied in a p@@ ool at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of win@@ ter in B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New Yor@@ k .
And I didn &apos;t see the oce@@ an , a real oce@@ an , for another two years , un@@ ti@@ l we mo@@ ved to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
S@@ in@@ ce then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 4@@ 0 years , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent about 3@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s under@@ water , and 5@@ 00 h@@ our@@ s of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ b@@ les .
And I &apos;ve lear@@ ned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ oce@@ an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment , and even the sh@@ al@@ low oce@@ ans , are so r@@ ich with a@@ ma@@ zing life that really is be@@ y@@ ond our ima@@ gin@@ ation .
N@@ at@@ ure &apos;s ima@@ gin@@ ation is so b@@ oun@@ d@@ less comp@@ ar@@ ed to our own me@@ a@@ ger human ima@@ gin@@ ation .
I still , to this day , stand in ab@@ solu@@ te a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves .
And my love a@@ ff@@ a@@ ir with the oce@@ an is on@@ going , and just as str@@ ong as it ever was .
But when I ch@@ ose a car@@ e@@ er as an ad@@ ul@@ t , it was fil@@ m@@ making .
And that se@@ em@@ ed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ c@@ ile this ur@@ ge I had to tell stor@@ ies with my ur@@ ges to create ima@@ ges .
And I was , as a k@@ id , con@@ stan@@ tly dra@@ wing com@@ ic boo@@ ks , and so on .
So , fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pic@@ tu@@ res and stor@@ ies together , and that made sense .
And of course the stor@@ ies that I ch@@ ose to tell were sci@@ ence fic@@ tion stor@@ ies : &quot; T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or , &quot; &quot; A@@ li@@ ens &quot; and &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
And with &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss , &quot; I was pu@@ tting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ making .
So , you know , mer@@ ging the two pas@@ si@@ ons .
S@@ ome@@ thing interesting came out of &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to sol@@ ve a speci@@ f@@ ic n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water cre@@ at@@ ure , we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anim@@ ation , C@@ G .
And this resul@@ ted in the first s@@ of@@ t-@@ sur@@ face char@@ ac@@ ter , C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a mo@@ v@@ ie .
And even thou@@ gh the film didn &apos;t make any money -- b@@ ar@@ ely bro@@ ke even , I should say -- I wit@@ ne@@ ss@@ ed something a@@ ma@@ zing , which is that the au@@ di@@ ence , the glob@@ al au@@ di@@ ence , was me@@ s@@ mer@@ ized by this app@@ ar@@ ent ma@@ gi@@ c .
You know , it &apos;s A@@ r@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s la@@ w that any su@@ ff@@ ici@@ en@@ tly ad@@ van@@ c@@ ed technology is in@@ di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from ma@@ gi@@ c .
They were se@@ e@@ ing something ma@@ g@@ ical .
And so that got me very ex@@ c@@ ited .
And I thought , &quot; W@@ ow , this is something that ne@@ eds to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the c@@ in@@ em@@ ati@@ c art . &quot;
So , with &quot; T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much f@@ ar@@ ther .
W@@ or@@ king with I@@ L@@ M , we cre@@ ated the li@@ qu@@ id me@@ tal du@@ de in that film . The succ@@ ess h@@ un@@ g in the b@@ al@@ ance on w@@ he@@ ther that eff@@ ect would work .
And it did , and we cre@@ ated ma@@ gi@@ c again ,
and we had the same resul@@ t with an au@@ di@@ ence --
al@@ thou@@ gh we did make a little more money on that one .
So , dra@@ wing a line through those two d@@ ots of experi@@ ence came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity for film arti@@ sts .
So , I started a comp@@ any with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , my good fri@@ end St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ at@@ ure desig@@ ner at that time , and it was called D@@ ig@@ it@@ al D@@ om@@ a@@ in .
And the con@@ cep@@ t of the comp@@ any was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g pa@@ st the an@@ al@@ o@@ g proc@@ ess@@ es of op@@ tic@@ al pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to dig@@ it@@ al produc@@ tion .
And we actually did that and it ga@@ ve us a com@@ pe@@ tit@@ i@@ ve ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge for a wh@@ ile .
But we found our@@ selves la@@ g@@ ging in the m@@ id &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ at@@ ure and char@@ ac@@ ter design stuff that we had actually f@@ oun@@ ded the comp@@ any to do .
So , I wr@@ ot@@ e this pie@@ ce called &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was me@@ ant to ab@@ solu@@ tely p@@ us@@ h the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ec@@ ts , of C@@ G eff@@ ec@@ ts , be@@ y@@ ond , with real@@ ist@@ ic human em@@ ot@@ i@@ ve char@@ ac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G , and the ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G , and the world would be in C@@ G . And the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e p@@ us@@ he@@ d back ,
and I was t@@ old by the f@@ ol@@ ks at my comp@@ any that we wer@@ en &apos;t going to be able to do this for a wh@@ ile .
So , I s@@ hel@@ ved it , and I made this other mo@@ v@@ ie about a big shi@@ p that sin@@ ks .
You know , I went and p@@ it@@ ch@@ ed it to the stu@@ di@@ o as &quot; &apos; R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et &apos; on a shi@@ p :
&quot; It &apos;s going to be this ep@@ ic r@@ om@@ ance , pas@@ sion@@ ate film . &quot;
S@@ ec@@ re@@ tly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I made the mo@@ v@@ ie .
And that &apos;s the tru@@ th . Now , the stu@@ di@@ o didn &apos;t know that .
But I con@@ vin@@ c@@ ed them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k . We &apos;re going to film it for real .
We &apos;ll be using it in the open@@ ing of the film .
It will be really important . It will be a great mar@@ ke@@ ting h@@ ook . &quot;
And I tal@@ ked them into fun@@ ding an ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tion .
S@@ oun@@ ds c@@ ra@@ z@@ y . But this go@@ es back to that the@@ me about your ima@@ gin@@ ation cre@@ ating a real@@ ity .
Because we actually cre@@ ated a real@@ ity where si@@ x mon@@ th@@ s later , I find my@@ self in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ sible two and a half mi@@ les down in the nor@@ th A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic , looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a vie@@ w por@@ t . No@@ t a mo@@ v@@ ie , not H@@ D -- for real .
Now , that b@@ le@@ w my m@@ ind .
And it took a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation , we had to buil@@ d cam@@ er@@ as and li@@ gh@@ ts and all kin@@ ds of things .
But , it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve , these de@@ ep di@@ ves , was like a space mis@@ sion .
You know , where it was hi@@ gh@@ ly tech@@ n@@ ical , and it re@@ qu@@ i@@ red enor@@ m@@ ous plan@@ ning .
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this d@@ ar@@ k ho@@ st@@ ile en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment where there is no hop@@ e of re@@ sc@@ ue if you can &apos;t get back by y@@ our@@ self .
And I thought like , &quot; W@@ ow . I &apos;m like , li@@ ving in a sci@@ ence fic@@ tion mo@@ v@@ ie .
This is really c@@ ool . &quot;
And so , I really got b@@ itten by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ oce@@ an ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation .
O@@ f course , the cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , the sci@@ ence comp@@ on@@ ent of it --
it was everything . It was ad@@ ven@@ ture , it was cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , it was ima@@ gin@@ ation . And it was an experi@@ ence that H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood cou@@ ldn &apos;t give me .
Because , you know , I could ima@@ g@@ ine a cre@@ at@@ ure and we could create a vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ect for it . But I cou@@ ldn &apos;t ima@@ g@@ ine what I was se@@ e@@ ing out that win@@ do@@ w .
A@@ s we did some of our sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , I was se@@ e@@ ing cre@@ at@@ u@@ res at hy@@ d@@ ro@@ ther@@ m@@ al ven@@ ts and some@@ times things that I had never s@@ een before , some@@ times things that no one had s@@ een before , that actually were not de@@ scri@@ be@@ d by sci@@ ence at the time that we sa@@ w them and ima@@ ged them .
So , I was comple@@ tely sm@@ itten by this , and had to do more .
And so , I actually made a kind of cur@@ i@@ ous de@@ ci@@ sion .
Af@@ ter the succ@@ ess of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to par@@ k my day jo@@ b as a H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ ood mo@@ v@@ ie ma@@ ker , and I &apos;m going to go be a f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ time ex@@ pl@@ or@@ er for a wh@@ ile . &quot;
And so , we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
And we w@@ ound up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k , and ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing it with ro@@ bot@@ ic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k .
We took little bot@@ s that we had cre@@ ated that sp@@ oo@@ led a fi@@ b@@ er op@@ tic .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ ve@@ y of that shi@@ p , which had never been done .
No@@ body had ever loo@@ ked in@@ side the w@@ rec@@ k . They didn &apos;t have the me@@ ans to do it , so we cre@@ ated technology to do it .
So , you know , here I am now , on the de@@ c@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , s@@ it@@ ting in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where I k@@ new that the b@@ and had pla@@ y@@ ed .
And I &apos;m fl@@ ying a little ro@@ bot@@ ic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the shi@@ p .
When I say , &quot; I &apos;m op@@ er@@ ating it , &quot; but my m@@ ind is in the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le . I f@@ elt like I was ph@@ ys@@ ically pres@@ ent in@@ side the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experi@@ ence I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I tur@@ ned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the li@@ gh@@ ts of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it , because I had wal@@ ked the set for mon@@ th@@ s when we were making the mo@@ v@@ ie .
And the set was bas@@ ed as an ex@@ act re@@ p@@ lic@@ a on the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the shi@@ p .
So , it was this ab@@ solu@@ tely re@@ mar@@ k@@ able experi@@ ence .
And it really made me re@@ ali@@ ze that the tel@@ e@@ presen@@ ce experi@@ ence -- that you actually can have these ro@@ bot@@ ic av@@ at@@ ars , then your con@@ sci@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss is in@@ jec@@ ted into the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le , into this other form of ex@@ ist@@ ence .
It was really , really quite pro@@ found .
And it may be a little bit of a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happen@@ ing some de@@ ca@@ des out as we start to have c@@ y@@ bor@@ g bo@@ di@@ es for ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation or for other me@@ ans in many sort of po@@ st@@ -@@ human fu@@ tu@@ res that I can ima@@ g@@ ine , as a sci@@ ence fic@@ tion f@@ an .
So , ha@@ ving done these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , and really begin@@ ning to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate what was down there , s@@ uch as at the de@@ ep oce@@ an ven@@ ts where we had these a@@ ma@@ zing , a@@ ma@@ zing anim@@ als --
they &apos;re bas@@ ically ali@@ ens right here on Earth .
They live in an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment of ch@@ em@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ the@@ s@@ is .
They don &apos;t sur@@ vi@@ ve on s@@ un@@ li@@ gh@@ t-@@ bas@@ ed system the way we do .
And so , you &apos;re se@@ e@@ ing anim@@ als that are li@@ ving next to a 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de water pl@@ u@@ mes .
You think they can &apos;t pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly ex@@ ist .
A@@ t the same time I was getting very interest@@ ed in space sci@@ ence as well -- again , it &apos;s the sci@@ ence fic@@ tion inf@@ lu@@ ence , as a k@@ id .
And I w@@ ound up getting in@@ vol@@ ved with the space commun@@ ity , really in@@ vol@@ ved with N@@ A@@ S@@ A , s@@ it@@ ting on the N@@ A@@ S@@ A ad@@ vis@@ or@@ y bo@@ ard , plan@@ ning ac@@ tu@@ al space mis@@ si@@ ons , going to R@@ us@@ si@@ a , going through the pre@@ -@@ c@@ os@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ ome@@ dic@@ al prot@@ oc@@ ol@@ s , and all these sor@@ ts of things , to actually go and f@@ ly to the inter@@ n@@ ational space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D cam@@ er@@ a syste@@ ms .
And this was f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
But what I w@@ ound up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing space sci@@ enti@@ sts with us into the de@@ ep .
And ta@@ king them down so that they had ac@@ c@@ ess -- a@@ st@@ ro@@ bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ sts , plan@@ et@@ ary sci@@ enti@@ sts , people who were interest@@ ed in these ex@@ tre@@ me en@@ vir@@ on@@ ments -- ta@@ king them down to the ven@@ ts , and le@@ tting them see , and take sa@@ mp@@ les and te@@ st in@@ stru@@ ments , and so on .
So , here we were making do@@ cu@@ men@@ t@@ ary fil@@ ms , but actually doing sci@@ ence , and actually doing space sci@@ ence .
I &apos;d comple@@ tely c@@ los@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the sci@@ ence fic@@ tion f@@ an , you know , as a k@@ id , and doing this stuff for real .
And you know , al@@ ong the way in this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of disc@@ o@@ very , I lear@@ ned a lot .
I lear@@ ned a lot about sci@@ ence . But I also lear@@ ned a lot about lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p .
Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a lea@@ der , lea@@ der of , cap@@ ta@@ in of the shi@@ p , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really lear@@ n about lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p un@@ ti@@ l I did these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
Because I had to , at a cer@@ ta@@ in point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Wh@@ y am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;
We don &apos;t make money at these da@@ m@@ n sho@@ ws .
We b@@ ar@@ ely bre@@ a@@ k even . There is no fa@@ me in it .
P@@ e@@ ople sort of think I went away between &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic &quot; and &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ il@@ s some@@ place , s@@ it@@ ting at the be@@ ach .
Ma@@ de all these fil@@ ms , made all these do@@ cu@@ men@@ t@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very lim@@ ited au@@ di@@ ence .
No fa@@ me , no g@@ l@@ or@@ y , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the t@@ as@@ k it@@ self , for the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge -- and the oce@@ an is the most ch@@ all@@ en@@ ging en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment there is -- for the th@@ r@@ ill of disc@@ o@@ very , and for that str@@ an@@ ge b@@ ond that happ@@ ens when a sm@@ all gr@@ ou@@ p of people form a ti@@ gh@@ tly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am .
Because we would do these things with 10 , 1@@ 2 people , working for years at a time ,
some@@ times at se@@ a for two , three mon@@ th@@ s at a time .
And in that b@@ ond , you re@@ ali@@ ze that the most important thing is the resp@@ ect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a t@@ as@@ k that you can &apos;t ex@@ pla@@ in to some@@ one el@@ se .
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fi@@ b@@ er op@@ tic , and the at@@ ten@@ tu@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty , the hu@@ man@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce a@@ spec@@ ts of working at se@@ a , &quot; you can &apos;t ex@@ pla@@ in it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe c@@ op@@ s have , or people in com@@ b@@ at that have g@@ one through something together and they know they can never ex@@ pla@@ in it .
C@@ re@@ ates a b@@ ond , cre@@ ates a b@@ ond of resp@@ ect .
So , when I came back to make my next mo@@ v@@ ie , which was &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; I tr@@ ied to app@@ ly that same prin@@ ci@@ ple of lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p , which is that you resp@@ ect your te@@ am , and you ear@@ n their resp@@ ect in re@@ tur@@ n .
And it really chan@@ ged the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic .
So , here I was again with a sm@@ all te@@ am , in un@@ char@@ ted ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y , doing &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t ex@@ ist before .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous@@ ly ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous@@ ly ch@@ all@@ en@@ ging .
And we bec@@ a@@ me a fam@@ ily , over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ half year peri@@ od .
And it comple@@ tely chan@@ ged how I do mo@@ v@@ ies .
So , people have com@@ men@@ ted on how , &quot; Well , you know , you br@@ ou@@ ght back the oce@@ an organis@@ ms and put them on the plan@@ et of P@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
T@@ o me , it was more of a fun@@ da@@ men@@ tal way of doing bu@@ sin@@ ess , the proc@@ ess it@@ self , that chan@@ ged as a resul@@ t of that .
So , what can we sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ ze out of all this ?
You know , what are the le@@ ss@@ ons lear@@ ned ?
Well , I think number one is cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
It &apos;s the most po@@ wer@@ ful thing you own .
I@@ ma@@ gin@@ ation is a for@@ ce that can actually man@@ i@@ fe@@ st a real@@ ity .
And the resp@@ ect of your te@@ am is more important than all the la@@ ur@@ els in the world .
I have y@@ oun@@ g fil@@ m@@ ma@@ kers come up to me and say , &quot; G@@ i@@ ve me some ad@@ v@@ ice for doing this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t put lim@@ it@@ ations on y@@ our@@ self .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to y@@ our@@ self , don &apos;t b@@ et aga@@ in@@ st y@@ our@@ self ,
and take ris@@ ks . &quot;
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has this ph@@ ra@@ se that they like : &quot; F@@ a@@ il@@ ure is not an op@@ tion . &quot;
But fa@@ il@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of fa@@ it@@ h .
And no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that re@@ qu@@ i@@ red in@@ no@@ v@@ ation was done with@@ out ris@@ k .
You have to be wil@@ ling to take those ris@@ ks .
So , that &apos;s the thought I would lea@@ ve you with , is that in wh@@ at@@ ever you &apos;re doing , fa@@ il@@ ure is an op@@ tion , but fe@@ ar is not . Thank you .
If I can lea@@ ve you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we con@@ su@@ me is gre@@ ater that the su@@ m of the par@@ ts ,
and in@@ ste@@ ad of thinking about inform@@ ation over@@ lo@@ ad , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use inform@@ ation so that pat@@ ter@@ ns p@@ op and we can see tr@@ en@@ ds that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se be in@@ vi@@ sible .
So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typ@@ ical mor@@ tal@@ ity ch@@ art organ@@ ized by age .
This t@@ ool that I &apos;m using here is a little experi@@ ment .
It &apos;s called P@@ i@@ vo@@ t , and with P@@ i@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can ch@@ o@@ ose to fil@@ ter in one parti@@ cu@@ lar c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ th@@ s -- say , ac@@ ci@@ den@@ ts .
And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pat@@ ter@@ n that em@@ er@@ ges .
This is because , in the mid@@ -@@ are@@ a here , people are at their most acti@@ ve , and over here they &apos;re at their most f@@ ra@@ il .
We can ste@@ p back out again and then re@@ organ@@ i@@ ze the data by c@@ ause of de@@ at@@ h ,
se@@ e@@ ing that c@@ ir@@ cul@@ at@@ or@@ y di@@ se@@ as@@ es and c@@ anc@@ er are the u@@ su@@ al su@@ spec@@ ts , but not for every@@ one .
If we go a@@ he@@ ad and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 4@@ 0 years or less -- we see that ac@@ ci@@ den@@ ts are actually the gre@@ at@@ est c@@ ause that people have to be wor@@ r@@ ied about .
And if you dr@@ ill into that , it &apos;s e@@ speci@@ ally the ca@@ se for men .
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing inform@@ ation , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like s@@ w@@ im@@ ming in a li@@ ving inform@@ ation in@@ fo@@ -@@ grap@@ hi@@ c .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for cont@@ ent as well ?
So what we have right here is the c@@ over of every s@@ ing@@ le S@@ por@@ ts I@@ l@@ lu@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed .
It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the we@@ b .
You can go back to your r@@ oo@@ ms and try this after my talk .
W@@ it@@ h P@@ i@@ vo@@ t , you can dr@@ ill into a de@@ ca@@ de .
You can dr@@ ill into a parti@@ cu@@ lar year .
You can ju@@ m@@ p right into a speci@@ f@@ ic is@@ su@@ e .
So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the a@@ th@@ le@@ tes that have ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed in this is@@ su@@ e , the sp@@ or@@ ts .
I &apos;m a L@@ ance A@@ r@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an , so I &apos;ll go a@@ he@@ ad and I &apos;ll c@@ lic@@ k on that , which re@@ ve@@ als , for me , all the is@@ su@@ es in which L@@ ance A@@ r@@ m@@ str@@ ong &apos;s been a part of .
Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about ta@@ king a look at all of c@@ y@@ c@@ ling ? &quot;
So I can ste@@ p back , and exp@@ and on that .
And I see G@@ re@@ g L@@ e@@ M@@ ond now .
And so you get the idea that when you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate over inform@@ ation this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ a@@ der , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not bro@@ w@@ sing .
You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it chan@@ ges the way inform@@ ation can be used .
So I want to ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve ta@@ ken every s@@ ing@@ le W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia pa@@ ge and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little su@@ m@@ mar@@ y .
So the su@@ m@@ mar@@ y con@@ si@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to in@@ dic@@ ate the t@@ op@@ ical are@@ a that it comes from .
I &apos;m only sho@@ wing the top 5@@ 00 most pop@@ u@@ lar W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia pa@@ ges right here .
But even in this lim@@ ited vie@@ w , we can do a lot of things .
Ri@@ ght away , we get a sense of what are the t@@ op@@ ical d@@ om@@ a@@ ins that are most pop@@ u@@ lar on W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia .
I &apos;m going to go a@@ he@@ ad and sel@@ ect go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment .
Now , ha@@ ving sel@@ ec@@ ted go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment , I can now see that the W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia c@@ at@@ eg@@ or@@ ies that most f@@ re@@ qu@@ en@@ tly cor@@ resp@@ ond to that are T@@ i@@ me ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine P@@ e@@ ople of the Y@@ e@@ ar .
So this is really important because this is an in@@ si@@ ght that was not con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed with@@ in any one W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia pa@@ ge .
It &apos;s only pos@@ sible to see that in@@ si@@ ght when you ste@@ p back and look at all of them .
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these parti@@ cu@@ lar su@@ m@@ mar@@ ies , I can then dr@@ ill into the con@@ cep@@ t of T@@ i@@ me ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine P@@ er@@ son of the Y@@ e@@ ar , br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them .
So looking at these people , I can see that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity come from go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment ;
some have come from nat@@ ur@@ al sci@@ en@@ ces ;
some , fe@@ wer still , have come from bu@@ sin@@ ess --
there &apos;s my b@@ os@@ s --
and one has come from mu@@ sic .
And interest@@ ing@@ ly enough , B@@ on@@ o is also a TED P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ner .
So we can go , ju@@ m@@ p , and take a look at all the TED P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ n@@ ers .
So you see , we &apos;re na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a we@@ b , not from pa@@ ge@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ pa@@ ge , but at a hi@@ gh@@ er lev@@ el of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion .
And so I want to show you one other thing that may c@@ at@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pri@@ se .
I &apos;m just sho@@ wing the New Yor@@ k T@@ im@@ es we@@ b@@ s@@ ite here .
So P@@ i@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- I don &apos;t want to call it a bro@@ w@@ s@@ er ; it &apos;s really not a bro@@ w@@ s@@ er , but you can vie@@ w we@@ b pa@@ ges with it -- and we br@@ ing that z@@ oo@@ ma@@ ble technology to every s@@ ing@@ le we@@ b pa@@ ge like this .
So I can ste@@ p back , p@@ op right back into a speci@@ f@@ ic sec@@ tion .
Now the reas@@ on why this is important is because , by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ wing we@@ b pa@@ ges in this way , I can look at my enti@@ re bro@@ w@@ sing hi@@ story in the ex@@ act same way .
So I can dr@@ ill into what I &apos;ve done over speci@@ f@@ ic time f@@ ra@@ mes .
Here , in fact , is the st@@ ate of all the de@@ m@@ o that I just ga@@ ve .
And I can sort of re@@ pla@@ y some stuff that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er today .
And , if I want to ste@@ p back and look at everything , I can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my hi@@ story , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s by my se@@ ar@@ ch hi@@ story --
here , I was doing some ne@@ p@@ ot@@ ist@@ ic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for B@@ ing , over here for L@@ i@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ vo@@ t .
And from these , I can dr@@ ill into the we@@ b pa@@ ge and just la@@ un@@ ch them again .
It &apos;s one me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ p@@ ur@@ pos@@ ed m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple times , and in each ca@@ se it ma@@ kes the whole gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts with the data .
So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
We talk about the cur@@ se of inform@@ ation over@@ lo@@ ad .
We talk about d@@ ro@@ w@@ ning in data .
What if we can actually tur@@ n that up@@ side down and tur@@ n the we@@ b up@@ side down , so that in@@ ste@@ ad of na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the ha@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the pat@@ ter@@ ns that were o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se hi@@ dden ?
If we can do that , then in@@ ste@@ ad of being tr@@ app@@ ed in data , we might actually ex@@ tr@@ act inform@@ ation .
And , in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ al@@ ing just with inform@@ ation , we can te@@ ase out kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge .
And if we get the kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , then maybe even there &apos;s wis@@ d@@ om to be found .
So with that , I th@@ ank you .
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happ@@ in@@ ess these da@@ ys .
I had some@@ body coun@@ t the number of boo@@ ks with &quot; happ@@ in@@ ess &quot; in the tit@@ le pub@@ li@@ s@@ he@@ d in the last five years and they ga@@ ve up after about 4@@ 0 , and there were many more .
There is a hu@@ ge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happ@@ in@@ ess , am@@ ong re@@ se@@ arch@@ ers .
There is a lot of happ@@ in@@ ess co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people happ@@ ier .
But in sp@@ ite of all this fl@@ ood of work , there are se@@ ver@@ al c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tr@@ ap@@ s that sort of make it al@@ most im@@ pos@@ sible to think stra@@ i@@ ght about happ@@ in@@ ess .
And my talk today will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tr@@ ap@@ s .
This ap@@ pl@@ ies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happ@@ in@@ ess , and it ap@@ pl@@ ies to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happ@@ in@@ ess , because it tur@@ ns out we &apos;re just as me@@ ss@@ ed up as any@@ body el@@ se is .
The first of these tr@@ ap@@ s is a rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ m@@ it comple@@ x@@ ity .
It tur@@ ns out that the wor@@ d &quot; happ@@ in@@ ess &quot; is just not a u@@ se@@ ful wor@@ d any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things .
I think there is one parti@@ cu@@ lar me@@ an@@ ing to which we might re@@ str@@ ic@@ t it , but by and lar@@ ge , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to ad@@ op@@ t the more comp@@ lic@@ ated vie@@ w of what wel@@ l@@ -@@ being is .
The second tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between experi@@ ence and me@@ mor@@ y ; bas@@ ically , it &apos;s between being happ@@ y in your life , and being happ@@ y about your life or happ@@ y with your life .
And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re bot@@ h lu@@ mp@@ ed in the not@@ ion of happ@@ in@@ ess .
And the th@@ ir@@ d is the f@@ oc@@ using il@@ lu@@ sion , and it &apos;s the un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any c@@ ir@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ ance that a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ts wel@@ l@@ -@@ being with@@ out di@@ stor@@ ting its import@@ ance .
I mean , this is a real c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tra@@ p .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of some@@ body who had a quest@@ i@@ on@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ ans@@ wer se@@ s@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tu@@ res re@@ por@@ ted a story ,
and that was a story --
He said he &apos;d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ mp@@ h@@ on@@ y , and it was ab@@ solu@@ tely g@@ l@@ or@@ i@@ ous mu@@ sic and at the very end of the rec@@ or@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful sc@@ ree@@ ch@@ ing s@@ ound .
And then he ad@@ ded , really quite em@@ ot@@ i@@ on@@ ally , it ru@@ in@@ ed the whole experi@@ ence .
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ in@@ ed were the me@@ mor@@ ies of the experi@@ ence .
He had had the experi@@ ence .
He had had 20 minu@@ tes of g@@ l@@ or@@ i@@ ous mu@@ sic .
They coun@@ ted for no@@ thing because he was le@@ ft with a me@@ mor@@ y ; the me@@ mor@@ y was ru@@ in@@ ed , and the me@@ mor@@ y was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to ke@@ ep .
What this is tel@@ ling us , really , is that we might be thinking of our@@ selves and of other people in ter@@ ms of two selves .
There is an experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , who li@@ ves in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the pa@@ st , but bas@@ ically it has only the pres@@ ent .
It &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self that the do@@ c@@ tor ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es -- you know , when the do@@ c@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I t@@ ou@@ ch you here ? &quot;
And then there is a re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ ore , and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the do@@ c@@ tor ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the question , &quot; How have you been fe@@ el@@ ing l@@ at@@ ely ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
Th@@ ose are two very different en@@ tit@@ ies , the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the me@@ ss about the not@@ ion of happ@@ in@@ ess .
Now , the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ er .
And that really star@@ ts with a ba@@ sic resp@@ on@@ se of our me@@ mor@@ ies -- it star@@ ts im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely .
We don &apos;t only tell stor@@ ies when we set out to tell stor@@ ies .
O@@ ur me@@ mor@@ y tel@@ ls us stor@@ ies , that is , what we get to ke@@ ep from our experi@@ en@@ ces is a story .
And let me begin with one example .
This is an old stu@@ dy .
Th@@ ose are ac@@ tu@@ al p@@ ati@@ ents under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful proc@@ ed@@ ure .
I w@@ on &apos;t go into de@@ ta@@ il . It &apos;s no l@@ on@@ ger pa@@ in@@ ful these da@@ ys , but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this stu@@ dy was ru@@ n in the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s .
They were as@@ ked to re@@ por@@ t on their pa@@ in every 6@@ 0 sec@@ on@@ ds .
Here are two p@@ ati@@ ents ,
those are their rec@@ or@@ d@@ ings .
And you are as@@ ked , &quot; Wh@@ o of them su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very e@@ as@@ y question .
C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more --
his col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y was l@@ on@@ ger , and every minu@@ te of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these p@@ ati@@ ents think they su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a sur@@ pri@@ se . The sur@@ pri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se me@@ mor@@ y of the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The stor@@ ies of the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ ies were different , and because a very cr@@ it@@ ical part of the story is how it en@@ ds . And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stor@@ ies is very in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ t ... but one of them is di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tly wor@@ se than the other .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ a@@ k at the very end ;
it &apos;s a b@@ ad story .
How do we know that ? Because we as@@ ked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How b@@ ad was the whole thing , in tot@@ al ? &quot;
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B , in me@@ mor@@ y .
Now this is a direc@@ t conf@@ lic@@ t between the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ ro@@ m the point of vie@@ w of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a wor@@ se time .
Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually r@@ an c@@ lin@@ ical experi@@ ments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ t@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in with@@ out j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
That will c@@ ause the p@@ ati@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
And if you do that for a cou@@ ple of minu@@ tes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off , and you have the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ w@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his experi@@ ence .
What de@@ fin@@ es a story ?
And that is tru@@ e of the stor@@ ies that me@@ mor@@ y del@@ i@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also tru@@ e of the stor@@ ies that we make up .
What de@@ fin@@ es a story are chan@@ ges , sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mom@@ ents and en@@ d@@ ings .
En@@ d@@ ings are very , very important and , in this ca@@ se , the en@@ ding d@@ om@@ in@@ ated .
Now , the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self li@@ ves its life contin@@ u@@ ous@@ ly .
It has mom@@ ents of experi@@ ence , one after the other .
And you can as@@ k : What happ@@ ens to these mom@@ ents ?
And the ans@@ wer is really stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ ward :
They are l@@ ost for@@ ever .
I mean , most of the mom@@ ents of our life -- and I c@@ al@@ cul@@ ated , you know , the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical pres@@ ent is said to be about three sec@@ on@@ ds long ;
that me@@ ans that , you know , in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them ;
in a m@@ ont@@ h , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 --
most of them don &apos;t lea@@ ve a tr@@ ace .
M@@ ost of them are comple@@ tely ig@@ nor@@ ed by the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
And y@@ et , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happ@@ ens d@@ ur@@ ing these mom@@ ents of experi@@ ence is our life .
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite res@@ our@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding wh@@ ile we &apos;re on this e@@ arth .
And how to sp@@ end it would se@@ em to be rel@@ e@@ v@@ ant , but that is not the story that the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us .
So we have the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , and they &apos;re really quite di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ t .
The bi@@ g@@ ge@@ st differ@@ ence between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
F@@ ro@@ m the point of vie@@ w of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second we@@ ek is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation .
That &apos;s not the way it wor@@ ks at all for the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ or the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , a tw@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation is b@@ ar@@ ely better than the on@@ e-@@ we@@ ek v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new me@@ mor@@ ies ad@@ ded .
You have not chan@@ ged the story .
And in this way , time is actually the cr@@ it@@ ical v@@ ari@@ able that di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ he@@ s a re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self ;
time has very little imp@@ act on the story .
Now , the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self does more than re@@ me@@ mber and tell stor@@ ies .
It is actually the one that ma@@ kes de@@ ci@@ si@@ ons because , if you have a p@@ ati@@ ent who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is de@@ ci@@ ding which of them to ch@@ o@@ ose , then the one that ch@@ o@@ os@@ es is the one that has the me@@ mor@@ y that is less b@@ ad , and that &apos;s the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en .
The experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self has no vo@@ ice in this ch@@ o@@ ice .
We actually don &apos;t ch@@ o@@ ose between experi@@ en@@ ces ,
we ch@@ o@@ ose between me@@ mor@@ ies of experi@@ en@@ ces . And even when we think about the fu@@ ture , we don &apos;t think of our fu@@ ture nor@@ m@@ ally as experi@@ en@@ ces .
We think of our fu@@ ture as an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated me@@ mor@@ ies .
And bas@@ ically you can look at this , you know , as a t@@ y@@ ran@@ n@@ y of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self through experi@@ en@@ ces that the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self doesn &apos;t need . I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very f@@ re@@ qu@@ en@@ tly the ca@@ se ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very lar@@ ge ex@@ t@@ ent , in the serv@@ ice of our re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
And this is a bit hard to ju@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ y I think .
I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our me@@ mor@@ ies ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is gi@@ ven for the d@@ om@@ in@@ ance of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
And when I think about that , I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was c@@ lear@@ ly the best v@@ ac@@ ation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it rel@@ ati@@ vel@@ y of@@ ten , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ations .
And I probably have con@@ su@@ m@@ ed my me@@ mor@@ ies of that th@@ ree@@ -@@ we@@ ek tri@@ p , I would say , for about 2@@ 5 minu@@ tes in the last four years .
Now , if I had ever open@@ ed the f@@ ol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pic@@ tu@@ res in it , I would have sp@@ ent another h@@ our .
Now , that is three we@@ e@@ ks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half .
There se@@ em@@ s to be a disc@@ re@@ p@@ anc@@ y .
Now , I may be a bit ex@@ tre@@ me , you know , in how little ap@@ pe@@ t@@ ite I have for con@@ su@@ ming me@@ mor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Wh@@ y do we put so much we@@ i@@ ght on me@@ mor@@ y rel@@ ative to the we@@ i@@ ght that we put on experi@@ en@@ ces ?
So I want you to think about a thought experi@@ ment .
I@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tu@@ res will be de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ sic dru@@ g so that you w@@ on &apos;t re@@ me@@ mber any@@ thing .
Now , would you ch@@ o@@ ose the same v@@ ac@@ ation ? And if you would ch@@ o@@ ose a different v@@ ac@@ ation , there is a conf@@ lic@@ t between your two selves ,
and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conf@@ lic@@ t ,
and it &apos;s actually not at all ob@@ vi@@ ous , because if you think in ter@@ ms of time , then you get one ans@@ wer ,
and if you think in ter@@ ms of me@@ mor@@ ies , you might get another ans@@ wer .
Wh@@ y do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that conf@@ ron@@ ts us with a ch@@ o@@ ice between the two selves .
Now , the two selves br@@ ing up two not@@ i@@ ons of happ@@ in@@ ess .
There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happ@@ in@@ ess that we can app@@ ly , one per self .
So you can as@@ k : How happ@@ y is the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self ?
And then you would as@@ k : How happ@@ y are the mom@@ ents in the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all -- happ@@ in@@ ess for mom@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ lic@@ ated proc@@ ess .
What are the em@@ ot@@ i@@ ons that can be me@@ as@@ u@@ red ?
And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pret@@ ty good idea of the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self over time .
If you as@@ k for the happ@@ in@@ ess of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a comple@@ tely different thing .
This is not about how happ@@ ily a person li@@ ves .
It is about how s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied or ple@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
Ver@@ y different not@@ ion .
An@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ ish those not@@ i@@ ons is going to me@@ ss up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ in@@ ess , and I bel@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of stu@@ den@@ ts of wel@@ l@@ -@@ being , who &apos;ve been me@@ ss@@ ing up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ in@@ ess for a long time in pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely this way .
The di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tion between the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self has been rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to me@@ as@@ ure the two se@@ par@@ at@@ ely . The G@@ all@@ up O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been as@@ ked quest@@ i@@ ons about what they think of their life and about their experi@@ en@@ ces ,
and there have been other ef@@ for@@ ts al@@ ong those lin@@ es .
So in rec@@ ent years , we have beg@@ un to lear@@ n about the happ@@ in@@ ess of the two selves .
And the ma@@ in le@@ ss@@ on I think that we have lear@@ ned is they are really different .
You can know how s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied some@@ body is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t te@@ ach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re li@@ ving their life , and v@@ ice vers@@ a .
J@@ ust to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 .
What that me@@ ans is if you met some@@ body , and you were t@@ old , &quot; Oh his fa@@ ther is si@@ x fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ i@@ ght ?
Well , you would know something about his he@@ i@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
You have that much un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty . If I tell you that some@@ body ran@@ ked their life ei@@ ght on a sc@@ ale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how happ@@ y they are with their experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the happ@@ in@@ ess self .
We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
We know that happ@@ in@@ ess is ma@@ in@@ ly being s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like .
There are other ple@@ as@@ u@@ res , but this is d@@ om@@ in@@ ant .
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze the happ@@ in@@ ess of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
The bot@@ t@@ om line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happ@@ in@@ ess as a sub@@ st@@ itu@@ te for wel@@ l@@ -@@ being .
It is a comple@@ tely different not@@ ion .
Now , very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , another reas@@ on we c@@ an@@ not think stra@@ i@@ ght about happ@@ in@@ ess is that we do not at@@ t@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you as@@ k the simp@@ le question of how happ@@ y people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t ans@@ wer .
When you as@@ k that question , you think people m@@ ust be happ@@ ier in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a if , say , you live in O@@ hi@@ o .
And what happ@@ ens is when you think about li@@ ving in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you are thinking of the con@@ tra@@ st between C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and other pl@@ ac@@ es , and that con@@ tra@@ st , say , is in c@@ lim@@ ate .
Well , it tur@@ ns out that c@@ lim@@ ate is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ f@@ lec@@ tive self that de@@ c@@ ide@@ s how happ@@ y people are .
But now , because the re@@ f@@ lec@@ tive self is in char@@ ge , you may end up -- some people may end up mo@@ ving to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happ@@ en to people who mo@@ ve to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a in the hop@@ e of getting happ@@ ier .
Well , their experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
We know that .
But one thing will happ@@ en : They will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o ,
and they will feel they made the right de@@ ci@@ sion .
It is very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to think stra@@ i@@ ght about wel@@ l@@ -@@ being , and I hop@@ e I have gi@@ ven you a sense of how diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t it is .
Thank you .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few we@@ e@@ ks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting resul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y .
I@@ s that something you can sh@@ are sin@@ ce you do have a few mom@@ ents le@@ ft now ?
D@@ an@@ ie@@ l K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man : S@@ ure . I think the most interesting resul@@ t that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y is a number , which we ab@@ solu@@ tely did not exp@@ ect to find .
We found that with resp@@ ect to the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
When we loo@@ ked at how fe@@ el@@ ings , v@@ ary with in@@ come .
And it tur@@ ns out that , bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year , for Amer@@ ic@@ ans -- and that &apos;s a very lar@@ ge sa@@ mp@@ le of Amer@@ ic@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 , so it &apos;s a lar@@ ge re@@ presen@@ t@@ ative sa@@ mp@@ le -- bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year ...
C@@ A : 6@@ 0@@ ,000 . D@@ K : 6@@ 0@@ ,000 . 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happ@@ y , and they get pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vel@@ y un@@ happ@@ ier the p@@ oor@@ er they get .
A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an ab@@ solu@@ tely fl@@ at line .
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely s@@ een lin@@ es so fl@@ at .
C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happen@@ ing is money does not bu@@ y you experi@@ enti@@ al happ@@ in@@ ess , but l@@ ack of money cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y , and we can me@@ as@@ ure that mis@@ er@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly .
In ter@@ ms of the other self , the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
The more money you ear@@ n , the more s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied you are .
That does not h@@ old for em@@ ot@@ i@@ ons .
C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ n@@ y , the whole Amer@@ ic@@ an en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , li@@ ber@@ ty , the p@@ ur@@ su@@ it of happ@@ in@@ ess .
If people took ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly that fin@@ ding , I mean , it se@@ em@@ s to tur@@ n up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y and so for@@ th .
I@@ s there any chan@@ ce that polit@@ ici@@ ans , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a fin@@ ding like that ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly and ru@@ n pub@@ li@@ c po@@ lic@@ y bas@@ ed on it ?
D@@ K : You know I think that there is rec@@ og@@ n@@ it@@ ion of the ro@@ le of happ@@ in@@ ess re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch in pub@@ li@@ c po@@ lic@@ y .
The rec@@ og@@ n@@ it@@ ion is going to be s@@ low in the U@@ n@@ ited St@@ ates , no question about that , but in the U@@ .@@ K@@ . , it is happen@@ ing , and in other coun@@ tries it is happen@@ ing .
P@@ e@@ ople are rec@@ og@@ ni@@ zing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happ@@ in@@ ess when they think of pub@@ li@@ c po@@ lic@@ y .
It &apos;s going to take a wh@@ ile , and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate w@@ he@@ ther they want to stu@@ dy experi@@ ence happ@@ in@@ ess , or w@@ he@@ ther they want to stu@@ dy life e@@ val@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate fa@@ ir@@ ly s@@ oon .
How to en@@ han@@ ce happ@@ in@@ ess go@@ es very different ways de@@ pen@@ ding on how you think , and w@@ he@@ ther you think of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
This is going to inf@@ lu@@ ence po@@ lic@@ y , I think , in years to come .
In the U@@ n@@ ited St@@ ates , ef@@ for@@ ts are being made to me@@ as@@ ure the experi@@ ence happ@@ in@@ ess of the pop@@ ul@@ ation .
This is going to be , I think , with@@ in the next de@@ ca@@ de or two , part of n@@ ational st@@ ati@@ st@@ ics .
C@@ A : Well , it se@@ em@@ s to me that this is@@ su@@ e will -- or at lea@@ st should be -- the most interesting po@@ lic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years .
Thank you so much for in@@ ven@@ ting be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics .
Thank you , D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and c@@ lim@@ ate .
And that might se@@ em a bit sur@@ pri@@ sing because my f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is mo@@ st@@ ly about v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es and se@@ eds , about the things that we need to in@@ v@@ ent and del@@ i@@ ver to help the p@@ oor@@ est two bil@@ lion live better li@@ ves .
But energy and c@@ lim@@ ate are ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to any@@ one el@@ se on the plan@@ et .
The c@@ lim@@ ate getting wor@@ se me@@ ans that many years , their c@@ ro@@ ps w@@ on &apos;t gro@@ w :
There will be too much ra@@ in , not enough ra@@ in ,
things will change in ways that their f@@ ra@@ g@@ ile en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment simp@@ ly can &apos;t su@@ p@@ por@@ t .
And that lea@@ ds to star@@ v@@ ation , it lea@@ ds to un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty , it lea@@ ds to un@@ re@@ st .
So , the c@@ lim@@ ate chan@@ ges will be ter@@ ri@@ ble for them .
Al@@ so , the pr@@ ice of energy is very important to them .
In fact , if you could pic@@ k just one thing to lo@@ wer the pr@@ ice of , to re@@ duc@@ e p@@ over@@ ty , by f@@ ar you would pic@@ k energy .
Now , the pr@@ ice of energy has come down over time .
R@@ e@@ ally ad@@ van@@ c@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation is bas@@ ed on ad@@ van@@ ces in energy .
The co@@ al re@@ volu@@ tion fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evolu@@ tion , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0@@ s we &apos;ve s@@ een a very r@@ ap@@ id de@@ c@@ line in the pr@@ ice of elec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ ors , a@@ ir@@ -@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing , we can make mo@@ der@@ n mater@@ i@@ als and do so many things .
And so , we &apos;re in a wonder@@ ful s@@ itu@@ ation with elec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity in the r@@ ich world .
But , as we make it ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er -- and let &apos;s go for making it tw@@ ice as ch@@ ea@@ p -- we need to me@@ et a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with C@@ O@@ 2 .
C@@ O@@ 2 is war@@ ming the plan@@ et , and the e@@ qu@@ ation on C@@ O@@ 2 is actually a very stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ ward one .
If you su@@ m up the C@@ O@@ 2 that ge@@ ts em@@ it@@ ted , that lea@@ ds to a te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ure incre@@ ase , and that te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ure incre@@ ase lea@@ ds to some very ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ec@@ ts :
the eff@@ ec@@ ts on the we@@ a@@ ther ; per@@ h@@ ap@@ s wor@@ se , the in@@ direc@@ t eff@@ ec@@ ts , in that the nat@@ ur@@ al ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ ms can &apos;t ad@@ just to these r@@ ap@@ id chan@@ ges , and so you get ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m col@@ l@@ ap@@ ses .
Now , the ex@@ act am@@ oun@@ t of how you ma@@ p from a cer@@ ta@@ in incre@@ ase of C@@ O@@ 2 to what te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ure will be and where the pos@@ iti@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty there , but not very much .
And there &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how b@@ ad those eff@@ ec@@ ts will be , but they will be ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely b@@ ad .
I as@@ ked the top sci@@ enti@@ sts on this se@@ ver@@ al times :
D@@ o we really have to get down to ne@@ ar z@@ er@@ o ?
C@@ an &apos;t we just c@@ ut it in half or a qu@@ ar@@ ter ?
And the ans@@ wer is that un@@ ti@@ l we get ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o , the te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ure will contin@@ ue to ri@@ se .
And so that &apos;s a big ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
It &apos;s very different than sa@@ ying &quot; We &apos;re a tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t-@@ hi@@ gh tru@@ c@@ k trying to get un@@ der a ten@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t b@@ ri@@ d@@ ge , and we can just sort of s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze un@@ der . &quot;
This is something that has to get to z@@ er@@ o .
Now , we put out a lot of car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ ide every year , over 2@@ 6 bil@@ lion t@@ ons .
F@@ or each Amer@@ ic@@ an , it &apos;s about 20 t@@ ons ;
for people in p@@ oor coun@@ tries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
It &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ age of about five t@@ ons for every@@ one on the plan@@ et .
And , some@@ how , we have to make chan@@ ges that will br@@ ing that down to z@@ er@@ o .
It &apos;s been con@@ stan@@ tly going up .
It &apos;s only v@@ ari@@ ous econom@@ ic chan@@ ges that have even fl@@ at@@ ten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly ri@@ sing to f@@ all@@ ing , and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to z@@ er@@ o .
This e@@ qu@@ ation has four fac@@ t@@ ors ,
a little bit of m@@ ul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ation :
So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the le@@ ft , C@@ O@@ 2 , that you want to get to z@@ er@@ o , and that &apos;s going to be bas@@ ed on the number of people , the serv@@ ic@@ es each person &apos;s using on a@@ ver@@ age , the energy on a@@ ver@@ age for each serv@@ ice , and the C@@ O@@ 2 being put out per un@@ it of energy .
So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to z@@ er@@ o .
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably , one of these nu@@ mb@@ ers is going to have to get pret@@ ty ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o .
Now that &apos;s back from hi@@ gh school al@@ geb@@ r@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
F@@ ir@@ st , we &apos;ve got pop@@ ul@@ ation .
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 bil@@ lion people .
That &apos;s he@@ a@@ ded up to about n@@ ine bil@@ lion .
Now , if we do a really great jo@@ b on new v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es , heal@@ th c@@ are , re@@ produc@@ tive heal@@ th serv@@ ic@@ es , we could lo@@ wer that by , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , 10 or 1@@ 5 percent , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3 .
The second fac@@ tor is the serv@@ ic@@ es we use .
This en@@ comp@@ as@@ ses everything : the food we e@@ at , c@@ lo@@ thing , T@@ V , he@@ ating .
These are very good things : getting ri@@ d of p@@ over@@ ty me@@ ans pro@@ vi@@ ding these serv@@ ic@@ es to al@@ most every@@ one on the plan@@ et .
And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
In the r@@ ich world , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s the top one bil@@ lion , we probably could c@@ ut back and use less , but every year , this number , on a@@ ver@@ age , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than d@@ ou@@ ble the serv@@ ic@@ es del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed per person .
Here we have a very ba@@ sic serv@@ ice :
D@@ o you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your hou@@ se to be able to re@@ ad your h@@ ome@@ work ? And , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and re@@ a@@ ding their school work un@@ der the stre@@ et la@@ mp@@ s .
Now , eff@@ ici@@ en@@ c@@ y , E , the energy for each serv@@ ice ,
here fin@@ ally we have some good ne@@ ws .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Th@@ rou@@ gh v@@ ari@@ ous in@@ ven@@ tions and new ways of doing li@@ gh@@ ting , through different typ@@ es of c@@ ars , different ways of building buil@@ d@@ ings --
there are a lot of serv@@ ic@@ es where you can br@@ ing the energy for that serv@@ ice down quite sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally .
S@@ ome indivi@@ du@@ al serv@@ ic@@ es even br@@ ing it down by 9@@ 0 percent .
There are other serv@@ ic@@ es like how we make f@@ er@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ er , or how we do a@@ ir tr@@ an@@ sp@@ ort , where the r@@ oo@@ ms for im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ment are f@@ ar , f@@ ar less .
And so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic , we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ tor of three to even , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , a fac@@ tor of si@@ x .
But for these first three fac@@ t@@ ors now , we &apos;ve g@@ one from 2@@ 6 bil@@ lion to , at best , maybe 1@@ 3 bil@@ lion t@@ ons , and that just w@@ on &apos;t c@@ ut it .
So let &apos;s look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a ke@@ y one -- and this is the am@@ oun@@ t of C@@ O@@ 2 put out per each un@@ it of energy .
And so the question is : C@@ an you actually get that to z@@ er@@ o ?
If you bur@@ n co@@ al , no .
If you bur@@ n nat@@ ur@@ al g@@ as , no .
Al@@ most every way we make elec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity today , ex@@ cep@@ t for the em@@ er@@ ging ren@@ e@@ wa@@ b@@ les and n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar , pu@@ ts out C@@ O@@ 2 .
And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a glob@@ al sc@@ ale , is create a new system .
And so , we need energy m@@ ir@@ ac@@ les .
Now , when I use the ter@@ m &quot; m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s im@@ pos@@ sible .
The m@@ ic@@ ro@@ proc@@ ess@@ or is a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le . The pers@@ on@@ al computer is a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le .
The In@@ ter@@ net and its serv@@ ic@@ es are a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le .
So , the people here have parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many m@@ ir@@ ac@@ les .
U@@ su@@ ally , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le by a cer@@ ta@@ in d@@ ate .
U@@ su@@ ally , you just kind of stand by , and some come al@@ ong , some don &apos;t .
This is a ca@@ se where we actually have to dri@@ ve at f@@ ul@@ l spe@@ ed and get a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le in a pret@@ ty ti@@ ght ti@@ m@@ el@@ ine .
Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really cap@@ ture this ?
I@@ s there some kind of nat@@ ur@@ al il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation , some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b people &apos;s ima@@ gin@@ ation here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I br@@ ou@@ ght m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ s , and some@@ how people en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed that .
It really got them in@@ vol@@ ved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ s .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I de@@ c@@ ide@@ d that rel@@ e@@ as@@ ing fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies would be my cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion to the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment here this year .
So here we have some nat@@ ur@@ al fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies .
I &apos;m t@@ old they don &apos;t b@@ ite ; in fact , they might not even lea@@ ve that j@@ ar .
Now , there &apos;s all sor@@ ts of g@@ im@@ m@@ ic@@ k@@ y solu@@ tions like that one , but they don &apos;t really ad@@ d up to much .
We need solu@@ tions -- ei@@ ther one or se@@ ver@@ al -- that have un@@ bel@@ ie@@ v@@ able sc@@ ale and un@@ bel@@ ie@@ v@@ able rel@@ i@@ abil@@ ity , and , al@@ thou@@ gh there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are se@@ e@@ king , I really only see five that can ach@@ ieve the big nu@@ mb@@ ers .
I &apos;ve le@@ ft out ti@@ de , ge@@ o@@ ther@@ m@@ al , fu@@ sion , bi@@ o@@ fu@@ els .
Th@@ ose may make some cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion , and if they can do better than I exp@@ ect , so much the better , but my ke@@ y point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges .
L@@ et &apos;s look first at the bur@@ ning f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els , ei@@ ther bur@@ ning co@@ al or bur@@ ning nat@@ ur@@ al g@@ as .
What you need to do there , se@@ em@@ s like it might be simp@@ le , but it &apos;s not ,
and that &apos;s to take all the C@@ O@@ 2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the f@@ lu@@ e , pre@@ ss@@ ur@@ i@@ ze it , create a li@@ qu@@ id , put it some@@ where , and hop@@ e it sta@@ ys there .
Now we have some p@@ il@@ o@@ t things that do this at the 6@@ 0 to 8@@ 0 percent lev@@ el , but getting up to that f@@ ul@@ l per@@ cen@@ ta@@ ge , that will be very tr@@ ic@@ k@@ y , and a@@ gre@@ e@@ ing on where these C@@ O@@ 2 qu@@ an@@ tit@@ ies should be put will be hard , but the t@@ ou@@ g@@ he@@ st one here is this l@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m is@@ su@@ e .
Wh@@ o &apos;s going to be s@@ ure ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is lit@@ er@@ ally bil@@ li@@ ons of times lar@@ ger than any typ@@ e of wa@@ ste you think of in ter@@ ms of n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar or other things ?
This is a lot of volu@@ me .
So that &apos;s a t@@ ough one .
N@@ ex@@ t would be n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar .
It also has three big proble@@ ms :
C@@ ost , parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly in hi@@ gh@@ ly re@@ g@@ ul@@ ated coun@@ tries , is hi@@ gh ;
the is@@ su@@ e of the sa@@ fe@@ ty , really fe@@ el@@ ing good about no@@ thing could go wr@@ ong , that , even thou@@ gh you have these human op@@ er@@ at@@ ors , that the fu@@ el doesn &apos;t get used for we@@ ap@@ ons .
And then what do you do with the wa@@ ste ?
And , al@@ thou@@ gh it &apos;s not very lar@@ ge , there are a lot of con@@ cer@@ ns about that .
P@@ e@@ ople need to feel good about it .
So three very t@@ ough proble@@ ms that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be wor@@ ked on .
The last three of the five , I &apos;ve gr@@ ou@@ p@@ ed together .
These are what people of@@ ten re@@ f@@ er to as the ren@@ e@@ wa@@ ble s@@ our@@ ces .
And they actually -- al@@ thou@@ gh it &apos;s great they don &apos;t re@@ qu@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some di@@ sa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ges .
One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy ga@@ ther@@ ed in these technolog@@ ies is dra@@ mat@@ ically less than a power pl@@ ant .
This is energy f@@ ar@@ ming , so you &apos;re tal@@ king about many s@@ qu@@ are mi@@ les , thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of time more are@@ a than you think of as a nor@@ m@@ al energy pl@@ ant .
Al@@ so , these are inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ ces .
The su@@ n doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , the w@@ ind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
And so , if you de@@ p@@ end on these s@@ our@@ ces , you have to have some way of getting the energy d@@ ur@@ ing those time peri@@ o@@ ds that it &apos;s not a@@ va@@ il@@ able .
So , we &apos;ve got big c@@ ost ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges here ,
we have trans@@ mis@@ sion ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges :
for example , say this energy s@@ our@@ ce is out@@ side your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to de@@ al with the ris@@ k of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
And , fin@@ ally , this stor@@ age problem .
And , to di@@ men@@ sion@@ ali@@ ze this , I went through and loo@@ ked at all the typ@@ es of b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for c@@ ars , for compu@@ ters , for ph@@ ones , for f@@ la@@ sh@@ li@@ gh@@ ts , for everything -- and comp@@ ar@@ ed that to the am@@ oun@@ t of elec@@ tr@@ ical energy the world us@@ es , and what I found is that all the b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies we make now could stor@@ e less than 10 minu@@ tes of all the energy .
And so , in fact , we need a big bre@@ a@@ k@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es we have now .
It &apos;s not im@@ pos@@ sible , but it &apos;s not a very e@@ as@@ y thing .
Now , this sho@@ ws up when you try to get the inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ ce to be ab@@ o@@ ve , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
If you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incre@@ di@@ ble m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le b@@ at@@ ter@@ y .
Now , how we &apos;re going to go for@@ ward on this -- what &apos;s the right ap@@ pro@@ ach ?
I@@ s it a M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an P@@ ro@@ ject ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
Well , we need l@@ ots of comp@@ an@@ ies working on this , h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds .
In each of these five pa@@ th@@ s , we need at lea@@ st a h@@ un@@ d@@ red people .
And a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re c@@ ra@@ z@@ y . &quot; That &apos;s good .
And , I think , here in the TED gr@@ ou@@ p , we have many people who are al@@ ready p@@ ur@@ su@@ ing this .
B@@ ill G@@ ros@@ s has se@@ ver@@ al comp@@ an@@ ies , in@@ clu@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ m@@ al technolog@@ ies .
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ l@@ a &apos;s in@@ ve@@ st@@ ing in do@@ z@@ ens of comp@@ an@@ ies that are doing great things and have interesting pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and I actually are bac@@ king a comp@@ any that , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s sur@@ pri@@ s@@ ing@@ ly , is actually ta@@ king the n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar ap@@ pro@@ ach .
There are some in@@ no@@ v@@ ations in n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar : mo@@ du@@ lar , li@@ qu@@ id .
And in@@ no@@ v@@ ation really stop@@ p@@ ed in this indu@@ str@@ y quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ide@@ as la@@ ying around is not all that sur@@ pri@@ sing .
The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ o@@ wer is that , in@@ ste@@ ad of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we de@@ c@@ ide@@ d , &quot; L@@ et &apos;s bur@@ n the 9@@ 9 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
It is kind of a c@@ ra@@ z@@ y idea .
In fact , people had tal@@ ked about it for a long time , but they could never si@@ m@@ ul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly w@@ he@@ ther it would work or not ,
and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ v@@ ent of mo@@ der@@ n su@@ per@@ compu@@ ters that now you can si@@ m@@ ul@@ ate and see that , y@@ es ,
with the right mater@@ ial &apos;s ap@@ pro@@ ach , this loo@@ ks like it would work .
And , because you &apos;re bur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 percent , you have gre@@ at@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ved c@@ ost pro@@ fil@@ e .
You actually bur@@ n up the wa@@ ste , and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver wa@@ ste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ t@@ ors .
So , in@@ ste@@ ad of wor@@ r@@ ying about them , you just take that . It &apos;s a great thing .
It bre@@ a@@ th@@ es this ur@@ an@@ i@@ um as it go@@ es al@@ ong , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
You can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , of@@ ten re@@ f@@ er@@ red to as a tra@@ vel@@ ing wa@@ ve re@@ ac@@ tor .
In ter@@ ms of fu@@ el , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a pic@@ ture here of a place in K@@ en@@ tu@@ c@@ k@@ y .
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 9@@ 9 percent , where they &apos;ve ta@@ ken out the part they bur@@ n now ,
so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ an@@ i@@ um .
That would power the U@@ .@@ S@@ . for h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of years .
And , simp@@ ly by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve proc@@ ess , you &apos;d have enough fu@@ el for the enti@@ re li@@ fe@@ time of the re@@ st of the plan@@ et .
So , you know , it &apos;s got l@@ ots of ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges a@@ he@@ ad , but it is an example of the many h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds and h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of ide@@ as that we need to mo@@ ve for@@ ward .
So let &apos;s think : How should we me@@ as@@ ure our@@ selves ?
What should our re@@ por@@ t c@@ ard look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ me@@ di@@ ate .
F@@ or 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve he@@ ard many people talk about this 8@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion .
That really is very important , that we get there .
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in p@@ oor coun@@ tries , still some a@@ gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture ,
hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly we will have c@@ le@@ an@@ ed up for@@ est@@ ry , c@@ e@@ ment .
So , to get to that 8@@ 0 percent , the develop@@ ed coun@@ tries , in@@ clu@@ ding coun@@ tries like Chin@@ a , will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their elec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity gener@@ ation al@@ together .
So , the other gra@@ de is : A@@ re we de@@ p@@ lo@@ ying this z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ em@@ is@@ sion technology , have we de@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ed it in all the develop@@ ed coun@@ tries and we &apos;re in the proc@@ ess of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
That &apos;s su@@ per important .
That &apos;s a ke@@ y ele@@ ment of making that re@@ por@@ t c@@ ard .
So , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ por@@ t c@@ ard look like ?
Well , again , it should have the two ele@@ ments .
We should go through these eff@@ ici@@ en@@ c@@ y me@@ as@@ u@@ res to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions :
The less we em@@ it , the less that su@@ m will be of C@@ O@@ 2 , and , ther@@ ef@@ ore , the less the te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ure .
But in some ways , the gra@@ de we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only e@@ qu@@ ally , or maybe even sli@@ gh@@ tly less , important than the other , which is the pie@@ ce of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation on these bre@@ a@@ k@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
These bre@@ a@@ k@@ throu@@ gh@@ s , we need to mo@@ ve those at f@@ ul@@ l spe@@ ed , and we can me@@ as@@ ure that in ter@@ ms of comp@@ an@@ ies , p@@ il@@ o@@ t pro@@ jec@@ ts , re@@ g@@ ul@@ at@@ or@@ y things that have been chan@@ ged .
There &apos;s a lot of great boo@@ ks that have been wr@@ itten about this .
The A@@ l G@@ ore b@@ ook , &quot; O@@ ur C@@ ho@@ ice &quot; and the D@@ av@@ id M@@ c@@ K@@ ay b@@ ook , &quot; S@@ u@@ sta@@ in@@ able En@@ erg@@ y W@@ i@@ th@@ out the Ho@@ t A@@ ir . &quot;
They really go through it and create a f@@ ra@@ me@@ work that this can be disc@@ us@@ s@@ ed bro@@ ad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
So this is a w@@ ish .
It &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te w@@ ish that we in@@ v@@ ent this technology .
If you ga@@ ve me only one w@@ ish for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k who &apos;s pre@@ si@@ dent , I could pic@@ k a v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine , which is something I love , or I could pic@@ k that this thing that &apos;s half the c@@ ost with no C@@ O@@ 2 ge@@ ts in@@ ven@@ ted -- this is the w@@ ish I would pic@@ k .
This is the one with the gre@@ at@@ est imp@@ act .
If we don &apos;t get this w@@ ish , the divi@@ sion between the people who think sh@@ ort ter@@ m and long ter@@ m will be ter@@ ri@@ ble , between the U@@ .@@ S@@ . and Chin@@ a , between p@@ oor coun@@ tries and r@@ ich , and most of all the li@@ ves of those two bil@@ lion will be f@@ ar wor@@ se .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to you to ste@@ p for@@ ward and dri@@ ve ?
We need to go for more re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch fun@@ ding .
When coun@@ tries get together in pl@@ ac@@ es like C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen , they sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t just disc@@ us@@ s the C@@ O@@ 2 .
They should disc@@ us@@ s this in@@ no@@ v@@ ation a@@ gen@@ d@@ a , and you &apos;d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous@@ ly low le@@ vel@@ s of sp@@ en@@ ding on these in@@ no@@ v@@ ative ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es .
We do need the mar@@ ket in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves -- C@@ O@@ 2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that ge@@ ts that pr@@ ice sig@@ n@@ al out there .
We need to get the me@@ s@@ sa@@ ge out .
We need to have this di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e be a more r@@ ational , more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e , in@@ clu@@ ding the ste@@ ps that the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment ta@@ kes .
This is an important w@@ ish , but it is one I think we can ach@@ ieve .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . So to understand more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ o@@ wer , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what sc@@ ale of in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment this is ?
B@@ il G@@ ates : T@@ o actually do the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are , bu@@ y the su@@ per@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great sci@@ enti@@ sts , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only t@@ ens of mil@@ li@@ ons , and even on@@ ce we te@@ st our mater@@ i@@ als out in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ tor to make s@@ ure that our mater@@ i@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of mil@@ li@@ ons .
The t@@ ough thing is building the p@@ il@@ o@@ t re@@ ac@@ tor ; fin@@ ding the se@@ ver@@ al bil@@ lion , fin@@ ding the re@@ g@@ ul@@ at@@ or , the loc@@ ation that will actually buil@@ d the first one of these .
On@@ ce you get the first one buil@@ t , if it wor@@ ks as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ s@@ ed , then it &apos;s just c@@ le@@ ar as day , because the econom@@ ics , the energy den@@ s@@ ity , are so different than n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar as we know it .
C@@ A : And so , to understand it right , this in@@ vol@@ ves building de@@ ep into the gr@@ ound al@@ most like a ver@@ tic@@ al kind of col@@ u@@ m@@ n of n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar fu@@ el , of this sort of sp@@ ent ur@@ an@@ i@@ um , and then the proc@@ ess star@@ ts at the top and kind of wor@@ ks down ?
B@@ G : That &apos;s right . To@@ day , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ ac@@ tor , so you have l@@ ots of people and l@@ ots of contro@@ ls that can go wr@@ ong : that thing where you &apos;re open@@ ing it up and mo@@ ving things in and out ,
that &apos;s not good .
So , if you have very ch@@ ea@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 6@@ 0 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ x@@ ities .
And it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 6@@ 0 years , and then it &apos;s done .
C@@ A : It &apos;s a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar power pl@@ ant that is its own wa@@ ste di@@ sp@@ os@@ al solu@@ tion .
B@@ G : Y@@ ea@@ h . Well , what happ@@ ens with the wa@@ ste , you can let it s@@ it there -- there &apos;s a lot less wa@@ ste un@@ der this ap@@ pro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and bur@@ n that .
And we start off actually by ta@@ king the wa@@ ste that ex@@ ist@@ s today , that &apos;s s@@ it@@ ting in these c@@ oo@@ ling p@@ oo@@ ls or dr@@ y c@@ as@@ king by re@@ ac@@ t@@ ors --
that &apos;s our fu@@ el to begin with .
So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ t@@ ors is actually what ge@@ ts f@@ ed into our@@ s , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the volu@@ me of the wa@@ ste quite dra@@ mat@@ ically as you &apos;re going through this proc@@ ess .
C@@ A : I mean , you &apos;re tal@@ king to different people around the world about the pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities here . W@@ here is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with this ?
B@@ G : Well , we ha@@ ven &apos;t pic@@ ked a parti@@ cu@@ lar place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disc@@ los@@ ure ru@@ les about any@@ thing that &apos;s called &quot; n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of inter@@ est , that people from the comp@@ any have been in R@@ us@@ si@@ a , India , Chin@@ a --
I &apos;ve been back se@@ e@@ ing the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of energy here , tal@@ king about how this f@@ its into the energy a@@ gen@@ d@@ a .
So I &apos;m op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic . You know , the F@@ ren@@ ch and J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se have done some work .
This is a v@@ ari@@ ant on something that has been done .
It &apos;s an important ad@@ van@@ ce , but it &apos;s like a fa@@ st re@@ ac@@ tor , and a lot of coun@@ tries have buil@@ t them , so any@@ body who &apos;s done a fa@@ st re@@ ac@@ tor is a c@@ an@@ di@@ d@@ ate to be where the first one ge@@ ts buil@@ t .
C@@ A : So , in your m@@ ind , ti@@ me@@ sc@@ ale and li@@ kel@@ i@@ h@@ ood of actually ta@@ king something like this live ?
B@@ G : Well , we need -- for one of these hi@@ gh@@ -@@ sc@@ ale , elec@@ tro@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that &apos;s very ch@@ ea@@ p , we have 20 years to in@@ v@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y .
That &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ tal mo@@ del@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to me@@ et .
And , you know , T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ o@@ wer , if things go well -- which is wis@@ h@@ ing for a lot -- could e@@ as@@ ily me@@ et that .
And there are , for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely now , do@@ z@@ ens of comp@@ an@@ ies -- we need it to be h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , if their sci@@ ence go@@ es well , if the fun@@ ding for their p@@ il@@ o@@ t plan@@ ts go@@ es well , that they can com@@ pe@@ te for this .
And it &apos;s best if m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple succ@@ e@@ ed , because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things .
We cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly need one to succ@@ e@@ ed .
C@@ A : In ter@@ ms of bi@@ g@@ -@@ sc@@ ale pos@@ sible ga@@ me chan@@ ges , is this the bi@@ g@@ ge@@ st that you &apos;re a@@ w@@ are of out there ?
B@@ G : A@@ n energy bre@@ a@@ k@@ through is the most important thing .
It would have been , even with@@ out the en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ tal con@@ stra@@ int , but the en@@ vir@@ on@@ men@@ tal con@@ stra@@ int just ma@@ kes it so much gre@@ ater .
In the n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar space , there are other in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ ors .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ du@@ lar people , that &apos;s a different ap@@ pro@@ ach .
There &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ typ@@ e re@@ ac@@ tor , which se@@ em@@ s a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
And so , there are different ones , but the beau@@ ty of this is a mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um has a million times as much energy as a mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le of , say , co@@ al , and so -- if you can de@@ al with the ne@@ g@@ ati@@ ves , which are es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally the ra@@ di@@ ation -- the f@@ oo@@ t@@ pr@@ int and c@@ ost , the p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al , in ter@@ ms of eff@@ ect on land and v@@ ari@@ ous things , is al@@ most in a c@@ la@@ ss of its own .
C@@ A : If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
D@@ o we have to start ta@@ king em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y me@@ as@@ u@@ res to try and ke@@ ep the te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ure of the e@@ arth st@@ able ?
B@@ G : If you get into that s@@ itu@@ ation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ e@@ ating , and you &apos;re about to have a he@@ art at@@ t@@ ack :
Th@@ en where do you go ? You may need he@@ art sur@@ ger@@ y or something .
There is a line of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ing , which are v@@ ari@@ ous tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to bu@@ y us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
Now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y .
You hop@@ e you don &apos;t need to do that .
S@@ ome people say you sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y , that you &apos;ll ke@@ ep e@@ ating because you know he@@ art sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to sa@@ ve you .
I &apos;m not s@@ ure that &apos;s wi@@ se , gi@@ ven the import@@ ance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ing disc@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back p@@ oc@@ ket in ca@@ se things happ@@ en fa@@ ster , or this in@@ no@@ v@@ ation go@@ es a lot s@@ lo@@ wer than we exp@@ ect ?
C@@ A : C@@ lim@@ ate s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s : If you had a sen@@ ten@@ ce or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ a@@ de them that they &apos;re wr@@ ong ?
B@@ G : Well , un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s come in different cam@@ ps .
The ones who make sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic ar@@ gu@@ ments are very few .
A@@ re they sa@@ ying that there &apos;s ne@@ g@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back eff@@ ec@@ ts that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chan@@ ce in a million of those things .
The ma@@ in problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
You make the mi@@ sta@@ ke now , and you pa@@ y for it a lot later .
And so , when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ gen@@ t proble@@ ms , the idea of ta@@ king pa@@ in now that has to do with a ga@@ in later , and a some@@ what un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in pa@@ in thing --
in fact , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ por@@ t , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily the wor@@ st ca@@ se , and there are people in the r@@ ich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say , &quot; OK , that is@@ n &apos;t that big of a de@@ al . &quot;
The fact is it &apos;s that un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in part that should mo@@ ve us to@@ war@@ ds this .
But my dre@@ am here is that , if you can make it econom@@ ic , and me@@ et the C@@ O@@ 2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t c@@ are that it doesn &apos;t put out C@@ O@@ 2 , I kind of w@@ ish it did put out C@@ O@@ 2 , but I gu@@ ess I &apos;ll ac@@ cep@@ t it because it &apos;s ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
C@@ A : And so , that would be your resp@@ on@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g ar@@ gu@@ ment , that bas@@ ically if you sp@@ end all this energy trying to sol@@ ve the C@@ O@@ 2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of p@@ over@@ ty and m@@ al@@ ari@@ a and so for@@ th ,
it &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id wa@@ ste of the Earth &apos;s res@@ our@@ ces to put money to@@ war@@ ds that when there are better things we can do .
B@@ G : Well , the ac@@ tu@@ al sp@@ en@@ ding on the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D pie@@ ce -- say the U@@ .@@ S@@ . should sp@@ end 10 bil@@ lion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ m@@ ati@@ c .
It sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t take away from other things .
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e , is when you have something that &apos;s n@@ on@@ -@@ econom@@ ic and you &apos;re trying to fu@@ nd that --
that , to me , mo@@ st@@ ly is a wa@@ ste .
U@@ n@@ less you &apos;re very cl@@ ose and you &apos;re just fun@@ ding the lear@@ ning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very ch@@ ea@@ p ,
I believe we should try more things that have a p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al to be f@@ ar less exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve .
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is , &quot; L@@ et &apos;s make energy su@@ per exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve , &quot; then the r@@ ich can af@@ for@@ d that .
I mean , all of us here could pa@@ y five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
The di@@ sa@@ ster is for that two bil@@ lion .
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has chan@@ ged .
H@@ is sh@@ tic@@ k now is , &quot; Wh@@ y is@@ n &apos;t the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D getting more disc@@ us@@ s@@ ed ? &quot;
He &apos;s still , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stuff , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic cam@@ p , but he &apos;s real@@ ized that &apos;s a pret@@ ty l@@ on@@ ely cam@@ p , and so , he &apos;s making the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D point .
And so there is a th@@ re@@ ad of something that I think is ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate .
The R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D pie@@ ce , it &apos;s c@@ ra@@ z@@ y how little it &apos;s fun@@ ded .
C@@ A : Well B@@ ill , I su@@ sp@@ ect I sp@@ ea@@ k on the be@@ half of most people here to say I really hop@@ e your w@@ ish comes tru@@ e . Thank you so much .
B@@ G : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to sh@@ are with you a disc@@ o@@ very that I made a few mon@@ th@@ s ago wh@@ ile wr@@ it@@ ing an ar@@ tic@@ le for I@@ tal@@ i@@ an W@@ i@@ red .
I always ke@@ ep my the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us hand@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I &apos;m wr@@ it@@ ing any@@ thing , but I &apos;d al@@ ready fin@@ is@@ he@@ d e@@ di@@ ting the pie@@ ce , and I real@@ ized that I had never on@@ ce in my life loo@@ ked up the wor@@ d &quot; di@@ s@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
L@@ et me re@@ ad you the en@@ try .
&quot; D@@ is@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ jec@@ tive : c@@ ri@@ p@@ ple@@ d , hel@@ ple@@ ss , u@@ sel@@ ess , w@@ rec@@ ked , st@@ alled , ma@@ im@@ ed , w@@ oun@@ ded , man@@ g@@ led , la@@ me , mu@@ t@@ il@@ ated , r@@ un@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , we@@ a@@ ken@@ ed , imp@@ ot@@ ent , ca@@ str@@ ated , par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed , han@@ dic@@ app@@ ed , sen@@ ile , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , la@@ id@@ -@@ up , d@@ on@@ e-@@ up , d@@ on@@ e-@@ for , d@@ on@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ac@@ ke@@ d@@ -@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d@@ -@@ out ; see also h@@ ur@@ t , u@@ sel@@ ess and we@@ a@@ k .
An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , heal@@ th@@ y , str@@ ong , cap@@ able . &quot;
I was re@@ a@@ ding this li@@ st out l@@ oud to a fri@@ end and at first was la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s , but I &apos;d just g@@ ot@@ ten pa@@ st &quot; man@@ g@@ led , &quot; and my vo@@ ice bro@@ ke , and I had to st@@ op and col@@ lec@@ t my@@ self from the em@@ ot@@ i@@ on@@ al sho@@ c@@ k and imp@@ act that the as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t from these wor@@ ds un@@ le@@ as@@ he@@ d .
You know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us
so I &apos;m thinking this m@@ ust be an an@@ ci@@ ent pr@@ int d@@ ate , right ?
But , in fact , the pr@@ int d@@ ate was the ear@@ ly 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , when I would have been star@@ ting pri@@ mar@@ y school and form@@ ing an under@@ stand@@ ing of my@@ self out@@ side the fam@@ ily un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me .
And , ne@@ ed@@ less to say , th@@ ank God I wa@@ sn &apos;t using a the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us back then .
I mean , from this en@@ try , it would se@@ em that I was bor@@ n into a world that per@@ c@@ ei@@ ved some@@ one like me to have no@@ thing pos@@ iti@@ ve wh@@ at@@ s@@ oe@@ ver going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated for the op@@ port@@ un@@ ities and ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ res my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
So , I im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely went to look up the 200@@ 9 on@@ line e@@ di@@ tion , exp@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ vi@@ sion wor@@ th not@@ ing .
Here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this en@@ try .
U@@ n@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two wor@@ ds un@@ der &quot; Ne@@ ar An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , &quot; parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly un@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ o@@ le@@ some . &quot;
So , it &apos;s not just about the wor@@ ds .
It &apos;s what we believe about people when we na@@ me them with these wor@@ ds .
It &apos;s about the val@@ u@@ es be@@ h@@ ind the wor@@ ds , and how we con@@ struc@@ t those val@@ u@@ es .
O@@ ur lan@@ gu@@ age a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ts our thinking and how we vie@@ w the world and how we vie@@ w other people .
In fact , many an@@ ci@@ ent soc@@ ie@@ ties , in@@ clu@@ ding the G@@ ree@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ ans , bel@@ ie@@ ved that to u@@ t@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so po@@ wer@@ ful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud br@@ ou@@ ght it into ex@@ ist@@ ence .
So , what real@@ ity do we want to call into ex@@ ist@@ ence : a person who is lim@@ ited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed ?
B@@ y c@@ as@@ u@@ ally doing something as simp@@ le as nam@@ ing a person , a chil@@ d , we might be pu@@ tting li@@ ds and ca@@ st@@ ing s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
W@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t we want to open door@@ s for them in@@ ste@@ ad ?
One s@@ uch person who open@@ ed door@@ s for me was my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood do@@ c@@ tor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ st@@ itu@@ te in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ el@@ a@@ w@@ are .
H@@ is na@@ me was D@@ r@@ . P@@ iz@@ z@@ u@@ t@@ ill@@ o ,
an I@@ tal@@ i@@ an Amer@@ ic@@ an , wh@@ ose na@@ me , app@@ ar@@ en@@ tly , was too diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t for most Amer@@ ic@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by D@@ r@@ . P@@ .
And D@@ r@@ . P always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very per@@ f@@ ect di@@ sp@@ os@@ it@@ ion to work with children .
I lo@@ ved al@@ most everything about my time sp@@ ent at this h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of my ph@@ ys@@ ical ther@@ ap@@ y se@@ s@@ si@@ ons .
I had to do what se@@ em@@ ed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able re@@ pe@@ tit@@ i@@ ons of ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es with these th@@ ick , el@@ a@@ st@@ ic b@@ and@@ s -- different col@@ ors , you know -- to help buil@@ d up my le@@ g mu@@ sc@@ les ,
and I h@@ ated these b@@ and@@ s more than any@@ thing --
I h@@ ated them , had nam@@ es for them . I h@@ ated them .
And , you know , I was al@@ ready b@@ ar@@ ga@@ in@@ ing , as a five ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old chil@@ d , with D@@ r@@ . P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es , un@@ succ@@ ess@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , of course .
And , one day , he came in to my se@@ s@@ sion -- ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ ve and un@@ for@@ gi@@ ving , these se@@ s@@ si@@ ons -- and he said to me , &quot; W@@ ow . A@@ i@@ mee , you are s@@ uch a str@@ ong and po@@ wer@@ ful little g@@ ir@@ l , I think you &apos;re going to bre@@ a@@ k one of those b@@ and@@ s .
When you do bre@@ a@@ k it , I &apos;m going to give you a h@@ un@@ d@@ red b@@ uc@@ ks . &quot;
Now , of course , this was a simp@@ le p@@ lo@@ y on D@@ r@@ . P &apos;s part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es I didn &apos;t want to do before the pr@@ os@@ p@@ ect of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old in the second fl@@ oor ward , but what he eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y did for me was re@@ sh@@ ap@@ e an a@@ w@@ ful da@@ ily oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ence into a new and pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing experi@@ ence for me .
And I have to w@@ onder today to what ex@@ t@@ ent his vi@@ sion and his de@@ c@@ lar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and po@@ wer@@ ful little g@@ ir@@ l sh@@ ap@@ ed my own vie@@ w of my@@ self as an in@@ her@@ en@@ tly str@@ ong , po@@ wer@@ ful and a@@ th@@ le@@ tic person well into the fu@@ ture .
This is an example of how ad@@ ul@@ ts in pos@@ iti@@ ons of power can ig@@ n@@ ite the power of a chil@@ d .
But , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous in@@ stan@@ ces of those the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us en@@ tries , our lan@@ gu@@ age is@@ n &apos;t al@@ lo@@ wing us to e@@ vol@@ ve into the real@@ ity that we would all want , the pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ity of an indivi@@ du@@ al to see the@@ m@@ selves as cap@@ able .
O@@ ur lan@@ gu@@ age ha@@ sn &apos;t c@@ au@@ ght up with the chan@@ ges in our soc@@ ie@@ ty , many of which have been br@@ ou@@ ght about by technology .
C@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly , from a me@@ dic@@ al stand@@ point , my le@@ gs , la@@ s@@ er sur@@ ger@@ y for vi@@ sion im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , tit@@ an@@ i@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ pl@@ ac@@ e@@ ments for a@@ ging bo@@ di@@ es that are al@@ lo@@ wing people to more f@@ ul@@ ly en@@ ga@@ ge with their abil@@ ities , and mo@@ ve be@@ y@@ ond the lim@@ its that nat@@ ure has im@@ pos@@ ed on them -- not to men@@ tion soc@@ ial net@@ working pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms al@@ low people to sel@@ f@@ -@@ i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y , to c@@ la@@ i@@ m their own de@@ scri@@ p@@ tions of the@@ m@@ selves , so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with glob@@ al gr@@ ou@@ ps of their own ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing .
So , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s technology is re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has always been a tru@@ th : that every@@ one has something r@@ are and po@@ wer@@ ful to off@@ er our soc@@ ie@@ ty , and that the human abil@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t is our gre@@ at@@ est as@@ set .
The human abil@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ u@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity , and I &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mis@@ sion :
This ph@@ ra@@ se never s@@ at right with me , and I always f@@ elt un@@ e@@ as@@ y trying to ans@@ wer people &apos;s quest@@ i@@ ons about it , and I think I &apos;m star@@ ting to fig@@ ure out why .
I@@ mp@@ lic@@ it in this ph@@ ra@@ se of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity &quot; is the idea that succ@@ ess , or happ@@ in@@ ess , is about em@@ er@@ ging on the other side of a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ging experi@@ ence un@@ sc@@ a@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experi@@ ence , as if my succ@@ ess@@ es in life have come about from an abil@@ ity to si@@ de@@ ste@@ p or c@@ ir@@ cu@@ m@@ na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the pre@@ su@@ m@@ ed p@@ it@@ f@@ al@@ ls of a life with pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic@@ s , or what other people per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve as my di@@ s@@ abil@@ ity .
But , in fact , we are chan@@ ged . We are mar@@ ked , of course , by a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge , w@@ he@@ ther ph@@ ys@@ ically , em@@ ot@@ i@@ on@@ ally or bot@@ h .
And I &apos;m going to su@@ g@@ ge@@ st that this is a good thing .
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is@@ n &apos;t an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in or@@ der to re@@ su@@ me li@@ ving our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I t@@ end to think of it like my s@@ ha@@ do@@ w .
S@@ ome@@ times I see a lot of it , some@@ times there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly , I &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the imp@@ act , the we@@ i@@ ght , of a person &apos;s stru@@ g@@ g@@ le .
There is ad@@ vers@@ ity and ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and rel@@ ative to every s@@ ing@@ le person , but the question is@@ n &apos;t w@@ he@@ ther or not you &apos;re going to me@@ et ad@@ vers@@ ity , but how you &apos;re going to me@@ et it .
So , our resp@@ on@@ si@@ bil@@ ity is not simp@@ ly shi@@ el@@ ding those we c@@ are for from ad@@ vers@@ ity , but pre@@ par@@ ing them to me@@ et it well .
And we do a di@@ s@@ serv@@ ice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not e@@ qu@@ i@@ pp@@ ed to ad@@ ap@@ t .
There &apos;s an important differ@@ ence and di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tion between the ob@@ jec@@ tive me@@ dic@@ al fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ te@@ e and the sub@@ jec@@ tive soc@@ ie@@ tal op@@ in@@ ion of w@@ he@@ ther or not I &apos;m di@@ s@@ ab@@ led .
And , tru@@ th@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , the only real and con@@ si@@ st@@ ent di@@ s@@ abil@@ ity I &apos;ve had to conf@@ ron@@ t is the world ever thinking that I could be de@@ scri@@ be@@ d by those de@@ fin@@ iti@@ ons .
In our de@@ si@@ re to prot@@ ect those we c@@ are about by gi@@ ving them the c@@ old , hard tru@@ th about their me@@ dic@@ al pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is , or , in@@ deed , a pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is on the exp@@ ec@@ ted qu@@ al@@ ity of their life , we have to make s@@ ure that we don &apos;t put the first br@@ ick in a w@@ all that will actually di@@ s@@ able some@@ one .
P@@ er@@ h@@ ap@@ s the ex@@ ist@@ ing model of only looking at what is bro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it , ser@@ ves to be more di@@ s@@ ab@@ ling to the indivi@@ du@@ al than the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y it@@ self .
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ging their p@@ ot@@ en@@ c@@ y , we are cre@@ ating another ill on top of wh@@ at@@ ever nat@@ ur@@ al stru@@ g@@ g@@ le they might have .
We are eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y gra@@ ding some@@ one &apos;s wor@@ th to our commun@@ ity .
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y and into the ran@@ ge of human cap@@ abil@@ ity .
And , most import@@ an@@ tly , there &apos;s a par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ shi@@ p between those per@@ c@@ ei@@ ved de@@ f@@ ici@@ en@@ c@@ ies and our gre@@ at@@ est cre@@ ative abil@@ ity .
So it &apos;s not about de@@ val@@ u@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to a@@ vo@@ id or s@@ we@@ ep un@@ der the ru@@ g , but in@@ ste@@ ad to find those op@@ port@@ un@@ ities wr@@ app@@ ed in the ad@@ vers@@ ity .
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is open@@ ing our@@ selves up to it , em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it , grap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ re@@ st@@ ling ter@@ m , maybe even d@@ anc@@ ing with it .
And , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as nat@@ ur@@ al , con@@ si@@ st@@ ent and u@@ se@@ ful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presen@@ ce of it .
This year we cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate the 200@@ th b@@ ir@@ th@@ day of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in , and it was 1@@ 50 years ago , when wr@@ it@@ ing about evolu@@ tion , that D@@ ar@@ w@@ in il@@ lu@@ str@@ ated , I think , a tru@@ th about the human char@@ ac@@ ter .
T@@ o par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se : It &apos;s not the str@@ onge@@ st of the spec@@ ies that sur@@ vi@@ ves , no@@ r is it the most intel@@ li@@ gen@@ t that sur@@ vi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ t@@ able to change .
C@@ on@@ f@@ lic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation .
F@@ ro@@ m D@@ ar@@ w@@ in &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ g@@ st o@@ th@@ ers , we can rec@@ og@@ ni@@ ze that the human abil@@ ity to sur@@ vi@@ ve and fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh is dri@@ ven by the stru@@ g@@ g@@ le of the human sp@@ ir@@ it through conf@@ lic@@ t into trans@@ form@@ ation .
So , again , trans@@ form@@ ation , ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ation , is our gre@@ at@@ est human sk@@ ill .
And , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , un@@ ti@@ l we &apos;re te@@ st@@ ed , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
Ma@@ ybe that &apos;s what ad@@ vers@@ ity gi@@ ves us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
So , we can give our@@ selves a gi@@ ft .
We can re@@ -@@ ima@@ g@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just t@@ ough times .
Ma@@ ybe we can see it as change .
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we ha@@ ven &apos;t ad@@ ap@@ ted our@@ selves to y@@ et .
I think the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ vers@@ ity that we &apos;ve cre@@ ated for our@@ selves is this idea of nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y .
Now , who &apos;s nor@@ m@@ al ?
There &apos;s no nor@@ m@@ al .
There &apos;s comm@@ on , there &apos;s typ@@ ical . There &apos;s no nor@@ m@@ al ,
and would you want to me@@ et that p@@ oor , be@@ ige person if they ex@@ ist@@ ed ?
I don &apos;t think so .
If we can change this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m from one of ach@@ ie@@ ving nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y to one of pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ity -- or p@@ ot@@ en@@ c@@ y , to be even a little bit more dan@@ ger@@ ous -- we can rel@@ ea@@ se the power of so many more children , and in@@ v@@ ite them to en@@ ga@@ ge their r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able abil@@ ities with the commun@@ ity .
An@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as hu@@ man@@ s have always re@@ qu@@ i@@ red of our commun@@ ity me@@ mb@@ ers is to be of use , to be able to cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ te .
There &apos;s e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce that Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago , car@@ r@@ ied their el@@ der@@ ly and those with ser@@ i@@ ous ph@@ ys@@ ical in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , and per@@ h@@ ap@@ s it &apos;s because the life experi@@ ence of sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of val@@ ue to the commun@@ ity . They didn &apos;t vie@@ w these people as bro@@ ken and u@@ sel@@ ess ; they were s@@ een as r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able .
A few years ago , I was in a food mar@@ ket in the to@@ wn where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , and I was stand@@ ing over a bu@@ s@@ he@@ l of t@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ es .
It was su@@ m@@ mer@@ time : I had sh@@ or@@ ts on .
I he@@ ar this gu@@ y , his vo@@ ice be@@ h@@ ind me say , &quot; Well , if it is@@ n &apos;t A@@ i@@ mee M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
And I tur@@ n around , and it &apos;s this ol@@ der man . I have no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , si@@ r , have we met ? I don &apos;t re@@ me@@ mber mee@@ ting you . &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t re@@ me@@ mber mee@@ ting me .
I mean , when we met I was del@@ i@@ ver@@ ing you from your mo@@ ther &apos;s w@@ om@@ b . &quot;
Oh , that gu@@ y .
And , but of course , actually , it did c@@ lic@@ k .
This man was D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an , a man that I had only kno@@ wn about through my mo@@ ther &apos;s stor@@ ies of that day , because , of course , typ@@ ical f@@ as@@ hi@@ on , I ar@@ ri@@ ved l@@ ate for my b@@ ir@@ th@@ day by two we@@ e@@ ks .
And so my mo@@ ther &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ an had g@@ one on v@@ ac@@ ation , so the man who del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed me was a comple@@ te str@@ an@@ ger to my par@@ ents .
And , because I was bor@@ n with@@ out the fi@@ b@@ ul@@ a b@@ ones , and had fe@@ et tur@@ ned in , and a few to@@ es in this f@@ oo@@ t and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ an@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of b@@ ad ne@@ ws .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is to your par@@ ents that you would never w@@ alk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bil@@ ity that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ ce . &quot;
The ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary thing is that he said he had sa@@ ved ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er c@@ li@@ pp@@ ings throu@@ gh@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood , w@@ he@@ ther win@@ ning a second gra@@ de spel@@ ling be@@ e , mar@@ ch@@ ing with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the H@@ al@@ lo@@ w@@ een par@@ a@@ de , win@@ ning my col@@ le@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p , or any of my sp@@ or@@ ts v@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ ies , and he was using it , and in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating it into te@@ ach@@ ing re@@ si@@ dent stu@@ den@@ ts , m@@ ed stu@@ den@@ ts from H@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man@@ n M@@ e@@ dic@@ al S@@ ch@@ ool and H@@ er@@ s@@ he@@ y M@@ e@@ dic@@ al S@@ ch@@ ool .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor , the p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al of the human will .
No pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is can ac@@ coun@@ t for how po@@ wer@@ ful this could be as a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ant in the qu@@ al@@ ity of some@@ one &apos;s life .
And D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experi@@ ence , un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly t@@ old o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , and even if gi@@ ven a mo@@ di@@ cu@@ m of su@@ p@@ por@@ t , if le@@ ft to their own de@@ v@@ ic@@ es , a chil@@ d will ach@@ ieve . &quot;
S@@ e@@ e , D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thinking .
He under@@ st@@ ood that there &apos;s a differ@@ ence between the me@@ dic@@ al con@@ di@@ tion and what some@@ one might do with it .
And there &apos;s been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time , in that , if you had as@@ ked me at 1@@ 5 years old , if I would have tra@@ ded pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic@@ s for f@@ le@@ sh@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one le@@ gs , I w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t have he@@ s@@ it@@ ated for a second .
I a@@ sp@@ i@@ red to that kind of nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y back then .
But if you as@@ k me today , I &apos;m not so s@@ ure .
And it &apos;s because of the experi@@ en@@ ces I &apos;ve had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the experi@@ en@@ ces I &apos;ve had with them .
And per@@ h@@ ap@@ s this shi@@ ft in me has happened because I &apos;ve been ex@@ pos@@ ed to more people who have open@@ ed door@@ s for me than those who have put li@@ ds and ca@@ st s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws on me .
S@@ e@@ e , all you really need is one person to show you the ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
If you can hand some@@ body the ke@@ y to their own power -- the human sp@@ ir@@ it is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for some@@ one at a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al moment , you are e@@ duc@@ ating them in the best sense .
You &apos;re te@@ ach@@ ing them to open door@@ s for the@@ m@@ selves .
In fact , the ex@@ act me@@ an@@ ing of the wor@@ d &quot; e@@ duc@@ ate &quot; comes from the r@@ oo@@ t wor@@ d &quot; e@@ duc@@ e . &quot;
It me@@ ans &quot; to br@@ ing for@@ th what is with@@ in , to br@@ ing out p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al . &quot;
So again , which p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al do we want to br@@ ing out ?
There was a ca@@ se stu@@ dy done in 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in , when they were mo@@ ving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r sch@@ oo@@ ls to comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve sch@@ oo@@ ls .
It &apos;s called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als . We call it &quot; tr@@ ac@@ king &quot; here in the St@@ ates .
It &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating stu@@ den@@ ts from A , B , C , D and so on .
And the &quot; A stu@@ den@@ ts &quot; get the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ um , the best te@@ ach@@ ers , et@@ c .
Well , they took , over a th@@ ree@@ -@@ m@@ ont@@ h peri@@ od , D@@ -@@ lev@@ el stu@@ den@@ ts , ga@@ ve them A &apos;s , t@@ old them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; t@@ old them they were b@@ right ,
and at the end of this th@@ ree@@ -@@ m@@ ont@@ h peri@@ od , they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ lev@@ el .
And , of course , the he@@ ar@@ t@@ bre@@ a@@ king , f@@ li@@ p side of this stu@@ dy , is that they took the &quot; A stu@@ den@@ ts &quot; and t@@ old them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot;
And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that th@@ ree@@ -@@ m@@ ont@@ h peri@@ od .
Th@@ ose who were still around in school , be@@ si@@ des the people who had d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed out .
A c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al part of this ca@@ se stu@@ dy was that the te@@ ach@@ ers were du@@ p@@ ed too .
The te@@ ach@@ ers didn &apos;t know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been made .
They were simp@@ ly t@@ old , &quot; These are the &apos; A@@ -@@ stu@@ den@@ ts , &apos; these are the &apos; D@@ -@@ stu@@ den@@ ts . &apos; &quot;
And that &apos;s how they went about te@@ ach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them .
So , I think that the only tru@@ e di@@ s@@ abil@@ ity is a c@@ ru@@ s@@ he@@ d sp@@ ir@@ it , a sp@@ ir@@ it that &apos;s been c@@ ru@@ s@@ he@@ d doesn &apos;t have hop@@ e ,
it doesn &apos;t see beau@@ ty ,
it no l@@ on@@ ger has our nat@@ ur@@ al , chil@@ d@@ like cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity and our in@@ n@@ ate abil@@ ity to ima@@ g@@ ine .
If in@@ ste@@ ad , we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human sp@@ ir@@ it to ke@@ ep hop@@ e , to see beau@@ ty in the@@ m@@ selves and o@@ th@@ ers , to be cur@@ i@@ ous and ima@@ gin@@ ative , then we are tru@@ ly using our power well .
When a sp@@ ir@@ it has those qu@@ al@@ ities , we are able to create new real@@ ities and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to lea@@ ve you with a p@@ oe@@ m by a f@@ our@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ cen@@ tur@@ y P@@ er@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed H@@ af@@ i@@ z that my fri@@ end , J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is t@@ old me about ,
and the p@@ oe@@ m is called &quot; The God Wh@@ o On@@ ly K@@ no@@ ws F@@ our W@@ or@@ ds &quot; :
&quot; E@@ very chil@@ d has kno@@ wn God , not the God of nam@@ es , not the God of don &apos;@@ ts , but the God who only kno@@ ws four wor@@ ds and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them , sa@@ ying , &apos; C@@ ome d@@ ance with me . C@@ ome , d@@ ance with me . C@@ ome , d@@ ance with me . &apos; &quot;
Thank you .
