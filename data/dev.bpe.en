La@@ st year I sho@@ w@@ ed these two sli@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the si@@ ze of the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 st@@ ates , has sh@@ r@@ un@@ k by 4@@ 0 percent .
But this under@@ st@@ ates the ser@@ i@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss of this parti@@ cu@@ lar problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ne@@ ss of the ice .
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating he@@ art of the glob@@ al c@@ lim@@ ate system .
It exp@@ and@@ s in win@@ ter and con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts in su@@ mm@@ er .
The next sli@@ de I show you will be a r@@ ap@@ id fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward of what &apos;s happened over the last 2@@ 5 years .
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
A@@ s you see , it exp@@ and@@ s to the d@@ ar@@ k bl@@ ue --
that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in win@@ ter ,
and it con@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts in su@@ mm@@ er .
The s@@ o@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice , five years old or ol@@ der , you can see is al@@ most like bl@@ ood , sp@@ il@@ ling out of the body here .
In 2@@ 5 years it &apos;s g@@ one from this , to this .
This is a problem because the war@@ ming he@@ at@@ s up the fro@@ zen gr@@ ound around the A@@ r@@ c@@ tic O@@ c@@ e@@ an , where there is a ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve am@@ oun@@ t of fro@@ zen car@@ b@@ on which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is tur@@ ned into me@@ th@@ an@@ e by m@@ ic@@ ro@@ be@@ s .
C@@ om@@ par@@ ed to the tot@@ al am@@ oun@@ t of glob@@ al war@@ ming pol@@ lu@@ tion in the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here , that am@@ oun@@ t could d@@ ou@@ ble if we cr@@ os@@ s this ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ al@@ low la@@ kes in A@@ la@@ sk@@ a , me@@ th@@ an@@ e is acti@@ vel@@ y bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water .
P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey W@@ al@@ ter from the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of A@@ la@@ sk@@ a went out with another te@@ am to another sh@@ al@@ low la@@ ke last win@@ ter .
V@@ ide@@ o : W@@ ho@@ a ! A@@ l G@@ ore : S@@ he &apos;s o@@ k@@ ay . The question is w@@ he@@ ther we will be .
And one reas@@ on is , this enor@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ at@@ s up G@@ re@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th .
This is an an@@ nu@@ al m@@ el@@ ting ri@@ ver .
But the volu@@ mes are much lar@@ ger than ever .
This is the K@@ an@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in s@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ st G@@ re@@ en@@ land .
If you want to know how se@@ a lev@@ el ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ ba@@ se ice m@@ el@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the se@@ a .
These f@@ lo@@ ws are incre@@ as@@ ing very r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly .
A@@ t the other end of the plan@@ et , An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the lar@@ ge@@ st ma@@ ss of ice on the plan@@ et .
La@@ st m@@ ont@@ h sci@@ enti@@ sts re@@ por@@ ted the enti@@ re contin@@ ent is now in ne@@ g@@ ative ice b@@ al@@ ance .
And we@@ st An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a c@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed up on top some under@@ -@@ se@@ a is@@ land@@ s , is parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly r@@ ap@@ id in its m@@ el@@ ting .
That &apos;s e@@ qu@@ al to 20 fe@@ et of se@@ a lev@@ el , as is G@@ re@@ en@@ land .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , the th@@ ir@@ d lar@@ ge@@ st ma@@ ss of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ ers .
4@@ 0 percent of all the people in the world get half of their dr@@ in@@ king water from that m@@ el@@ ting f@@ low .
In the An@@ des , this g@@ l@@ ac@@ ier is the s@@ our@@ ce of dr@@ in@@ king water for this c@@ ity .
The f@@ lo@@ ws have incre@@ as@@ ed .
But when they go away , so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king water .
In C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a there has been a 4@@ 0 percent de@@ c@@ line in the S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ack .
This is h@@ it@@ ting the re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s .
And the pre@@ dic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve re@@ ad , are ser@@ i@@ ous .
This dr@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a dra@@ m@@ ati@@ c incre@@ ase in fi@@ res .
And the di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers around the world have been incre@@ as@@ ing at an ab@@ solu@@ tely ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary and un@@ pre@@ c@@ e@@ den@@ ted r@@ ate .
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5 .
This is a comple@@ tely un@@ su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pat@@ ter@@ n .
If you look at in the con@@ te@@ xt of hi@@ story you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 million t@@ ons of C@@ O@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s --
2@@ 5 million t@@ ons every day to the oce@@ ans . L@@ ook car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at the are@@ a of the ea@@ ster@@ n P@@ ac@@ i@@ f@@ ic , from the Amer@@ ic@@ as , ex@@ ten@@ ding we@@ st@@ ward , and on ei@@ ther side of the In@@ di@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent , where there is a ra@@ dic@@ al de@@ ple@@ tion of o@@ x@@ y@@ gen in the oce@@ ans .
The bi@@ g@@ ge@@ st s@@ ing@@ le c@@ ause of glob@@ al war@@ ming , al@@ ong with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the bur@@ ning of f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
O@@ il is a problem , and co@@ al is the most ser@@ i@@ ous problem .
The U@@ n@@ ited St@@ ates is one of the two lar@@ ge@@ st em@@ it@@ ters , al@@ ong with Chin@@ a .
And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to buil@@ d a lot more co@@ al plan@@ ts .
But we &apos;re begin@@ ning to see a se@@ a change .
Here are the ones that have been c@@ an@@ cel@@ led in the last few years with some gre@@ en al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves pro@@ pos@@ ed .
Ho@@ we@@ ver there is a polit@@ ical b@@ at@@ tle in our country .
And the co@@ al indu@@ str@@ ies and the o@@ il indu@@ str@@ ies sp@@ ent a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a bil@@ lion dollars in the last c@@ al@@ en@@ da@@ r year pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing c@@ le@@ an co@@ al , which is an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
That ima@@ ge re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
A@@ r@@ ound Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s , in my h@@ ome in T@@ en@@ ne@@ s@@ see , a bil@@ lion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ d@@ ge was sp@@ il@@ led .
You probably sa@@ w it on the ne@@ ws .
This , all over the country , is the second lar@@ ge@@ st wa@@ ste stre@@ am in Amer@@ ica .
This happened around Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s .
One of the co@@ al indu@@ str@@ y &apos;s a@@ ds around Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s was this one .
V@@ ide@@ o : ♪ ♫ F@@ ro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happ@@ y s@@ ou@@ l .
He &apos;s ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant here in Amer@@ ica , and he hel@@ ps our econom@@ y gro@@ w .
F@@ ro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is getting c@@ le@@ an@@ er every@@ day .
He &apos;s af@@ for@@ d@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and wor@@ kers ke@@ ep their pa@@ y .
A@@ l G@@ ore : This is the s@@ our@@ ce of much of the co@@ al in W@@ est V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia .
The lar@@ ge@@ st m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ top min@@ er is the he@@ ad of M@@ as@@ se@@ y C@@ o@@ al .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ on B@@ lan@@ ken@@ shi@@ p : L@@ et me be c@@ le@@ ar about it . A@@ l G@@ ore , N@@ anc@@ y P@@ el@@ os@@ i , H@@ ar@@ ry R@@ e@@ id , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re tal@@ king about .
A@@ l G@@ ore : So the Al@@ li@@ ance for C@@ lim@@ ate P@@ r@@ ot@@ ec@@ tion has la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed two cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns .
This is one of them , part of one of them .
V@@ ide@@ o : A@@ c@@ tor : A@@ t C@@ O@@ A@@ L@@ erg@@ y we vie@@ w c@@ lim@@ ate change as a very ser@@ i@@ ous th@@ re@@ at to our bu@@ sin@@ ess .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our pri@@ mar@@ y go@@ al to sp@@ end a lar@@ ge su@@ m of money on an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing ef@@ for@@ t to help br@@ ing out and comp@@ lic@@ ate the tru@@ th about co@@ al .
The fact is , co@@ al is@@ n &apos;t di@@ r@@ ty .
We think it &apos;s c@@ le@@ an -- sm@@ el@@ ls good , too .
So don &apos;t wor@@ ry about c@@ lim@@ ate change .
L@@ ea@@ ve that up to us .
V@@ ide@@ o : A@@ c@@ tor : C@@ le@@ an co@@ al -- you &apos;ve he@@ ard a lot about it .
So let &apos;s take a t@@ our of this st@@ at@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art c@@ le@@ an co@@ al fac@@ il@@ ity .
A@@ ma@@ zing ! The mach@@ in@@ er@@ y is kind of l@@ oud .
But that &apos;s the s@@ ound of c@@ le@@ an co@@ al technology .
And wh@@ ile bur@@ ning co@@ al is one of the lea@@ ding c@@ au@@ ses of glob@@ al war@@ ming , the re@@ mar@@ k@@ able c@@ le@@ an co@@ al technology you see here chan@@ ges everything .
T@@ a@@ ke a good long look : this is today &apos;s c@@ le@@ an co@@ al technology .
A@@ l G@@ ore : F@@ in@@ ally , the pos@@ iti@@ ve al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative me@@ s@@ he@@ s with our econom@@ ic ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge and our n@@ ational sec@@ ur@@ ity ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
V@@ ide@@ o : N@@ ar@@ r@@ at@@ or : Amer@@ ica is in c@@ ris@@ is -- the econom@@ y , n@@ ational sec@@ ur@@ ity , the c@@ lim@@ ate c@@ ris@@ is .
The th@@ re@@ ad that lin@@ ks them all : our ad@@ dic@@ tion to car@@ b@@ on bas@@ ed fu@@ els , like di@@ r@@ ty co@@ al and for@@ ei@@ g@@ n o@@ il .
But now there is a b@@ old new solu@@ tion to get us out of this me@@ ss .
R@@ e@@ power Amer@@ ica with 100 percent c@@ le@@ an elec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity with@@ in 10 years .
A pl@@ an to put Amer@@ ica back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help st@@ op glob@@ al war@@ ming .
F@@ in@@ ally , a solu@@ tion that &apos;s big enough to sol@@ ve our proble@@ ms .
R@@ e@@ power Amer@@ ica . F@@ ind out more .
A@@ l G@@ ore : This is the last one .
V@@ ide@@ o : N@@ ar@@ r@@ at@@ or : It &apos;s about re@@ po@@ wer@@ ing Amer@@ ica .
One of the fa@@ ste@@ st ways to c@@ ut our de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce on old di@@ r@@ ty fu@@ els that are kil@@ ling our plan@@ et .

M@@ an # 2 : New in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments to create hi@@ gh@@ -@@ pa@@ ying jo@@ b@@ s .
N@@ ar@@ r@@ at@@ or : R@@ e@@ power Amer@@ ica . It &apos;s time to get real .
A@@ l G@@ ore : There is an old Afr@@ ic@@ an pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; If you want to go qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , go al@@ one .
If you want to go f@@ ar , go together . &quot;
We need to go f@@ ar , qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
Thank you very much .
La@@ st year at TED I ga@@ ve an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I pr@@ om@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that mach@@ ine wor@@ ked .
So this is it . And for those of you that wer@@ en &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ ge@@ st sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic experi@@ ment ever at@@ te@@ mp@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 kil@@ ome@@ ters in c@@ ir@@ cu@@ m@@ f@@ er@@ ence .
I@@ ts jo@@ b is to re@@ create the con@@ di@@ tions that were pres@@ ent less than a bil@@ li@@ ont@@ h of a second after the univer@@ se beg@@ an , up to 6@@ 00 million times a second .
It &apos;s no@@ thing if not am@@ b@@ iti@@ ous .
This is the mach@@ ine bel@@ ow G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
We take the pic@@ tu@@ res of those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ ig B@@ an@@ gs in@@ side de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ ors . This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wi@@ de , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in di@@ a@@ me@@ ter .
S@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ac@@ u@@ lar pic@@ ture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S un@@ der con@@ struc@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ ale .
O@@ n the 1@@ 0@@ th of S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber last year we tur@@ ned the mach@@ ine on for the first time .
And this pic@@ ture was ta@@ ken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It c@@ au@@ s@@ ed im@@ men@@ se cel@@ e@@ br@@ ation in the contro@@ l r@@ oom .
It &apos;s a pic@@ ture of the first be@@ am par@@ tic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a pie@@ ce of the L@@ H@@ C del@@ i@@ ber@@ at@@ ely , and sho@@ wer@@ ing par@@ tic@@ les into the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor .
In other wor@@ ds , when we sa@@ w that pic@@ ture on S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber 1@@ 0@@ th we k@@ new the mach@@ ine wor@@ ked , which is a great tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h .
I don &apos;t know w@@ he@@ ther this got the bi@@ g@@ ge@@ st ch@@ e@@ er , or this , when some@@ one went on@@ to G@@ oog@@ le and sa@@ w the f@@ ron@@ t pa@@ ge was like that .
It me@@ ans we made cul@@ tur@@ al imp@@ act as well as sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic imp@@ act .
A@@ b@@ out a we@@ ek later we had a problem with the mach@@ ine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of w@@ ire here -- these g@@ old wi@@ res .
Th@@ ose wi@@ res car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thou@@ s@@ and am@@ ps when the mach@@ ine is working in f@@ ul@@ l power .
Now the en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers am@@ on@@ g@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re sm@@ all wi@@ res . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are what &apos;s called su@@ per@@ con@@ duc@@ ting w@@ ire .
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the st@@ ars , those wi@@ res can take that cur@@ r@@ ent .
In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts in L@@ H@@ C , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect .
So the w@@ ire he@@ ated up sli@@ gh@@ tly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps su@@ d@@ den@@ ly en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed elec@@ tr@@ ical re@@ si@@ st@@ ance .
This was the resul@@ t .
Now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve when you con@@ si@@ der those ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts we@@ ig@@ h over 20 t@@ ons , and they mo@@ ved about a f@@ oo@@ t .
So we da@@ ma@@ ged about 50 of the ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We re@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ gr@@ ound now .
B@@ y the end of M@@ ar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again .
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on , and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ u@@ ly , and contin@@ ue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building b@@ loc@@ ks of the univer@@ se are .
Now of course , in a way those ac@@ ci@@ den@@ ts re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the val@@ ue of sci@@ ence and en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ing at the ed@@ ge . It &apos;s e@@ as@@ y to re@@ fu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the val@@ ue of things like the L@@ H@@ C .
I will lea@@ ve the fin@@ al wor@@ d to an En@@ g@@ li@@ sh sci@@ enti@@ st , H@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who , I su@@ sp@@ ect , when de@@ f@@ en@@ ding his prot@@ e@@ ge &apos;s u@@ sel@@ ess experi@@ ments -- his prot@@ e@@ ge was M@@ i@@ ch@@ a@@ el F@@ ar@@ a@@ day -- said this , &quot; No@@ thing is so dan@@ ger@@ ous to the pro@@ gre@@ ss of the human m@@ ind than to as@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of sci@@ ence are ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nat@@ ure , that our tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s are comple@@ te , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a k@@ id , pla@@ ying with b@@ loc@@ ks .
A@@ s you fig@@ u@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gra@@ s@@ p , pic@@ k them up and mo@@ ve them around , you were actually lear@@ ning how to think and sol@@ ve proble@@ ms by under@@ stand@@ ing and man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps .
S@@ p@@ ati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ ep@@ ly con@@ nec@@ ted to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer sci@@ enti@@ st in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this u@@ t@@ il@@ ity of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with ph@@ ys@@ ical ob@@ jec@@ ts -- al@@ ong with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ at@@ tie , and my col@@ la@@ bor@@ at@@ or J@@ e@@ e@@ van K@@ al@@ an@@ i@@ th@@ i -- I started to w@@ onder -- what if when we used a computer , in@@ ste@@ ad of ha@@ ving this one m@@ ou@@ se cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a dig@@ it@@ al f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p mo@@ ving around a fl@@ at de@@ sk@@ top , what if we could re@@ ach in with bot@@ h hand@@ s and gra@@ s@@ p inform@@ ation ph@@ ys@@ ically ,
ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
This question was so comp@@ el@@ ling that we de@@ c@@ ide@@ d to ex@@ pl@@ ore the ans@@ wer , by building S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
In a nu@@ t@@ s@@ hel@@ l , a S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able is an inter@@ acti@@ ve computer the si@@ ze of a c@@ oo@@ k@@ ie .
They &apos;re able to be mo@@ ved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their mot@@ ion , and they have a sc@@ re@@ en and a w@@ ir@@ el@@ ess ra@@ di@@ o .
M@@ ost import@@ an@@ tly , they &apos;re ph@@ ys@@ ical , so like the b@@ loc@@ ks , you can mo@@ ve them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gra@@ sp@@ ing .
And S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m of t@@ oo@@ ls for man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating dig@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation .
And as these t@@ oo@@ ls be@@ come more ph@@ ys@@ ical , more a@@ w@@ are of their mot@@ ion , a@@ w@@ are of each other , and a@@ w@@ are of the nu@@ ance of how we mo@@ ve them , we can start to ex@@ pl@@ ore some new and fu@@ n inter@@ ac@@ tion st@@ y@@ les .
So , I &apos;m going to start with some simp@@ le exam@@ p@@ les .
This S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able is conf@@ ig@@ u@@ red to show vide@@ o , and if I t@@ il@@ t it in one direc@@ tion , it &apos;ll ro@@ ll the vide@@ o this way ; if I t@@ il@@ t it the other way it ro@@ l@@ ls it bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
And these inter@@ acti@@ ve por@@ tra@@ its are a@@ w@@ are of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interest@@ ed .
If they get sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded , they not@@ ice that too , they might get a little f@@ lu@@ ster@@ ed .
And they can also sense their mot@@ ion and t@@ il@@ t .
One of the interesting imp@@ lic@@ ations on inter@@ ac@@ tion , we started to re@@ ali@@ ze , was that we could use every@@ day ge@@ stu@@ res on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a col@@ or the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ id .
So in this ca@@ se , we &apos;ve got three S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les conf@@ ig@@ u@@ red to be pa@@ int b@@ uc@@ ke@@ ts and I can use them to p@@ our col@@ or into that cen@@ tr@@ al one , where they get mi@@ x@@ ed .
If we over@@ sh@@ oo@@ t , we can p@@ our a little bit back .
There are also some ne@@ at pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities for e@@ duc@@ ation , like lan@@ gu@@ age , mat@@ h and lo@@ gi@@ c g@@ am@@ es where we want to give people the abil@@ ity to try things qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , and vie@@ w the resul@@ ts im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely .
So here I &apos;m -- This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ c@@ i se@@ qu@@ ence that I &apos;m making with a simp@@ le e@@ qu@@ ation progra@@ m .
Here we have a wor@@ d ga@@ me that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -@@ up between S@@ c@@ ra@@ b@@ ble and B@@ og@@ g@@ le .
B@@ as@@ ically , in every r@@ ound you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned let@@ ter on each S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able , and as you try to make wor@@ ds it ch@@ ec@@ ks aga@@ in@@ st a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
Th@@ en , after about 30 sec@@ on@@ ds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities to try .
Thank you .
So these are some kids that came on a fi@@ eld tri@@ p to the M@@ e@@ dia La@@ b , and I man@@ a@@ ged to get them to try it out , and sh@@ oo@@ t a vide@@ o .
They really lo@@ ved it .
And , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
A@@ ll you have to say is , &quot; Ma@@ ke wor@@ ds , &quot; and they know ex@@ ac@@ tly what to do .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
That &apos;s our y@@ oun@@ ge@@ st bet@@ a te@@ ster , down there on the right .
T@@ ur@@ ns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les up .
So to him , they were just b@@ loc@@ ks .
Now , this is an inter@@ acti@@ ve car@@ t@@ oon app@@ lic@@ ation .
And we wanted to buil@@ d a lear@@ ning t@@ ool for lan@@ gu@@ age lear@@ n@@ ers .
And this is F@@ el@@ i@@ x , actually .
And he can br@@ ing new char@@ ac@@ ters into the sc@@ ene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les off the t@@ able that have that char@@ ac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them .
Here , he &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the su@@ n out .
V@@ ide@@ o : The su@@ n is ri@@ sing .
D@@ av@@ id M@@ er@@ r@@ ill : Now he &apos;s br@@ ou@@ ght a tr@@ ac@@ tor into the sc@@ ene .
V@@ ide@@ o : The or@@ an@@ ge tr@@ ac@@ tor .
G@@ ood jo@@ b ! Y@@ ea@@ h !
D@@ M : So by s@@ ha@@ king the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les and pu@@ tting them next to each other he can make the char@@ ac@@ ters inter@@ act -- V@@ ide@@ o : W@@ oo@@ f !
D@@ M : in@@ ven@@ ting his own n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative .
V@@ ide@@ o : H@@ el@@ l@@ o !
D@@ M : It &apos;s an open@@ -@@ en@@ ded story ,
and he ge@@ ts to de@@ ci@@ de how it un@@ f@@ ol@@ ds .
V@@ ide@@ o : F@@ ly away , c@@ at .
D@@ M : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a mu@@ sic se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ing and live per@@ for@@ man@@ ce t@@ ool that we &apos;ve buil@@ t rec@@ en@@ tly , in which S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les act as s@@ oun@@ ds like le@@ ad , bas@@ s and dru@@ ms .
E@@ ach of these has four different v@@ ari@@ ations , you get to ch@@ o@@ ose which one you want to use .
And you can in@@ ject these s@@ oun@@ ds into a se@@ qu@@ ence that you can as@@ se@@ mb@@ le into the pat@@ ter@@ n that you want .
And you in@@ ject it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the s@@ ound S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able aga@@ in@@ st a se@@ qu@@ ence S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able . There are eff@@ ec@@ ts that you can contro@@ l live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
You at@@ t@@ ach it to a parti@@ cu@@ lar s@@ ound and then t@@ il@@ t to ad@@ just it .
And then , over@@ all eff@@ ec@@ ts like te@@ mp@@ o and volu@@ me that app@@ ly to the enti@@ re se@@ qu@@ ence .
So let &apos;s have a look .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : We &apos;ll start by pu@@ tting a le@@ ad into two se@@ qu@@ ence S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les , ar@@ ran@@ ge them into a ser@@ ies , ex@@ t@@ end it , ad@@ d a little more le@@ ad .
Now I put a bas@@ s line in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : Now I &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll at@@ t@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dru@@ ms , so I can contro@@ l the eff@@ ect live .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can spe@@ ed up the whole se@@ qu@@ ence by t@@ il@@ ting the te@@ mp@@ o one way or the other .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll at@@ t@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pres@@ sion .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the se@@ qu@@ ence wh@@ ile it pla@@ ys .
So I don &apos;t have to pl@@ an it out in ad@@ van@@ ce , but I can im@@ pro@@ vi@@ se , making it l@@ on@@ ger or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go .
And now , fin@@ ally , I can fa@@ de the whole se@@ qu@@ ence out using the volu@@ me S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able , t@@ il@@ ted to the le@@ ft .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my pas@@ sion is for making new hu@@ man@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bo@@ di@@ es work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities that we &apos;re working to br@@ ing out of the la@@ bor@@ at@@ or@@ y .
So the thought I want to lea@@ ve you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of t@@ oo@@ ls for inter@@ ac@@ ting with dig@@ it@@ al me@@ dia that are going to br@@ ing inform@@ ation into our world on our ter@@ ms .
Thank you very much .
I look for@@ ward to tal@@ king with all of you .
I am a wr@@ it@@ er .
W@@ r@@ it@@ ing boo@@ ks is my pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great li@@ f@@ el@@ ong love and f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ation . And I don &apos;t exp@@ ect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened rec@@ en@@ tly in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er , which has c@@ au@@ s@@ ed me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this work .
And the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I rec@@ en@@ tly wr@@ ot@@ e this b@@ ook , this me@@ mo@@ ir called &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , L@@ o@@ ve &quot; which , de@@ c@@ ide@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous boo@@ ks , went out in the world for some reas@@ on , and bec@@ a@@ me this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ s@@ ation , inter@@ n@@ ational be@@ st@@ sel@@ l@@ er thing .
The resul@@ t of which is that every@@ where I go now , people tre@@ at me like I &apos;m d@@ oo@@ m@@ ed .
S@@ er@@ i@@ ous@@ ly -- d@@ oo@@ m@@ ed , d@@ oo@@ m@@ ed !
L@@ i@@ ke , they come up to me now , all wor@@ r@@ ied , and they say , &quot; A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re going to ke@@ ep wr@@ it@@ ing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a b@@ ook that any@@ body in the world car@@ es about at all ,
ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
But it would be wor@@ se , ex@@ cep@@ t for that I happ@@ en to re@@ me@@ mber that over 20 years ago , when I was a te@@ en@@ a@@ ger , when I first started tel@@ ling people that I wanted to be a wr@@ it@@ er , I was met with this same sort of fe@@ ar@@ -@@ bas@@ ed re@@ ac@@ tion .
And people would say , &quot; A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id you &apos;re never going to have any succ@@ ess ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id the hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will k@@ ill you ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you af@@ ra@@ id that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this c@@ ra@@ ft and no@@ thing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of bro@@ ken dre@@ am@@ s with your m@@ ou@@ th fil@@ led with b@@ it@@ ter as@@ h of fa@@ il@@ ure ? &quot;
L@@ i@@ ke that , you know .
The ans@@ wer -- the sh@@ ort ans@@ wer to all those quest@@ i@@ ons is , &quot; Y@@ es . &quot;
Y@@ es , I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m af@@ ra@@ id of many , many more things be@@ si@@ des that people can &apos;t even gu@@ ess at ,
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary .
But , when it comes to wr@@ it@@ ing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ at@@ ely , and wonder@@ ing about l@@ at@@ ely ,
is why ? You know , is it r@@ ational ?
I@@ s it log@@ ical that any@@ body should be exp@@ ec@@ ted to be af@@ ra@@ id of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
And what is it speci@@ f@@ ically about cre@@ ative ven@@ tu@@ res that se@@ em@@ s to make us really n@@ erv@@ ous about each other &apos;s men@@ tal heal@@ th in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
L@@ i@@ ke my da@@ d , for example , was a ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er and I don &apos;t rec@@ all on@@ ce in his 4@@ 0 years of ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ing any@@ body as@@ king him if he was af@@ ra@@ id to be a ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er , you know ?
&quot; That ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ en@@ gin@@ eer@@ ing b@@ loc@@ k , J@@ o@@ h@@ n , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be fa@@ ir , ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers as a gr@@ ou@@ p ha@@ ven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation over the cen@@ tur@@ ies for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
We wr@@ it@@ ers , we kind of do have that re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation ,
and not just wr@@ it@@ ers , but cre@@ ative people ac@@ ros@@ s all gen@@ res , it se@@ em@@ s , have this re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation for being enor@@ m@@ ous@@ ly men@@ t@@ ally un@@ st@@ able .
And all you have to do is look at the very g@@ ri@@ m de@@ at@@ h coun@@ t in the 20@@ th cen@@ tur@@ y al@@ one , of really ma@@ g@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds
who di@@ ed y@@ oun@@ g and of@@ ten at their own hand@@ s , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t lit@@ er@@ ally comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de se@@ em to be really un@@ done by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
N@@ or@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er , just before he di@@ ed , last inter@@ vie@@ w , he said , &quot; E@@ very one of my boo@@ ks has kil@@ led me a little more . &quot;
A@@ n ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary st@@ at@@ e@@ ment to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even bl@@ in@@ k when we he@@ ar some@@ body say this ,
because we &apos;ve he@@ ard that kind of stuff for so long and some@@ how we &apos;ve comple@@ tely inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized and ac@@ cep@@ ted col@@ lec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y
this not@@ ion that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing are some@@ how in@@ her@@ en@@ tly lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y , in the end , will always ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely le@@ ad to an@@ gu@@ ish .
And the question that I want to as@@ k every@@ body here today is are you gu@@ ys all c@@ ool with that idea ?
A@@ re you com@@ for@@ t@@ able with that ?
Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all com@@ for@@ t@@ able with that as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
And I also think it &apos;s dan@@ ger@@ ous ,
and I don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next cen@@ tur@@ y .
I think it &apos;s better if we en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to live .
And I de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely know that , in my ca@@ se -- in my s@@ itu@@ ation -- it would be very dan@@ ger@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that d@@ ar@@ k pat@@ h
of as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly gi@@ ven the c@@ ir@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ ance that I &apos;m in right now in my car@@ e@@ er .
Wh@@ ich is -- you know , like ch@@ ec@@ k it out , I &apos;m pret@@ ty y@@ oun@@ g , I &apos;m only about 4@@ 0 years old .
I still have maybe another four de@@ ca@@ des of work le@@ ft in me .
And it &apos;s ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly li@@ kel@@ y that any@@ thing I wr@@ ite from this point for@@ ward is going to be ju@@ d@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the f@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ ish succ@@ ess of my last b@@ ook , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of fri@@ en@@ ds here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly li@@ kel@@ y that my gre@@ at@@ est succ@@ ess is be@@ h@@ ind me .
So J@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
That &apos;s the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a person to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ loc@@ k in the mor@@ ning ,
and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would pre@@ f@@ er to ke@@ ep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question be@@ comes , how ?
And so , it se@@ em@@ s to me , up@@ on a lot of re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion , that the way that I have to work now , in or@@ der to contin@@ ue wr@@ it@@ ing , is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ec@@ tive p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ struc@@ t , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe di@@ st@@ ance between me , as I am wr@@ it@@ ing , and my very nat@@ ur@@ al an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty about what the re@@ ac@@ tion to that wr@@ it@@ ing is going to be , from now on .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for mo@@ del@@ s for how to do that ,
I &apos;ve been sort of looking ac@@ ros@@ s time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other soc@@ ie@@ ties to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ide@@ as than we have about how to help cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent em@@ ot@@ i@@ on@@ al ris@@ ks of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity .
And that se@@ ar@@ ch has led me to an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome .
So sta@@ y with me , because it does c@@ ir@@ c@@ le around and back .
But , an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happ@@ en to believe that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity came from human be@@ ings back then , OK ?
P@@ e@@ ople bel@@ ie@@ ved that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity was this di@@ v@@ ine at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant sp@@ ir@@ it that came to human be@@ ings from some di@@ st@@ ant and un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble s@@ our@@ ce , for di@@ st@@ ant and un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble reas@@ ons .
The G@@ ree@@ ks fam@@ ous@@ ly called these di@@ v@@ ine at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant sp@@ ir@@ its of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
S@@ oc@@ r@@ ates , fam@@ ous@@ ly , bel@@ ie@@ ved that he had a da@@ em@@ on who sp@@ o@@ ke wis@@ d@@ om to him from af@@ ar .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea ,
but they called that sort of di@@ se@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us .
Wh@@ ich is great , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a parti@@ cul@@ ar@@ ly c@@ le@@ ver indivi@@ du@@ al .
They bel@@ ie@@ ved that a gen@@ i@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ g@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine en@@ t@@ ity , who was bel@@ ie@@ ved to lit@@ er@@ ally live in the wal@@ ls of an arti@@ st &apos;s stu@@ di@@ o ,
kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the hou@@ se el@@ f ,
and who would come out and sort of in@@ vi@@ si@@ b@@ ly as@@ si@@ st the arti@@ st with their work
and would sh@@ ap@@ e the out@@ come of that work .
So br@@ il@@ li@@ ant -- there it is , right there , that di@@ st@@ ance that I &apos;m tal@@ king about -- that p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ struc@@ t to prot@@ ect you from the resul@@ ts of your work .
And every@@ one k@@ new that this is how it fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ed , right ?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent arti@@ st was prot@@ ec@@ ted from cer@@ ta@@ in things , like , for example , too much n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ si@@ s@@ m , right ?
If your work was br@@ il@@ li@@ ant , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t take all the cre@@ dit for it ,
every@@ body k@@ new that you had this di@@ se@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ p@@ ed you .
If your work b@@ om@@ be@@ d , not enti@@ rel@@ y your fa@@ ul@@ t , you know ?
E@@ very@@ one k@@ new your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of la@@ me .
And this is how people thought about cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity in the W@@ est for a really long time .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything chan@@ ged ,
and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the indivi@@ du@@ al human being at the cen@@ ter of the univer@@ se ab@@ o@@ ve all go@@ ds and my@@ ster@@ ies ,
and there &apos;s no more r@@ oom for my@@ st@@ ical cre@@ at@@ u@@ res who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
And it &apos;s the begin@@ ning of r@@ ational hu@@ man@@ is@@ m ,
and people started to believe that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity came comple@@ tely from the self of the indivi@@ du@@ al .
And for the first time in hi@@ story , you start to he@@ ar people re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us , ra@@ ther than ha@@ ving a gen@@ i@@ us .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a hu@@ ge er@@ ro@@ r .
You know , I think that al@@ lo@@ wing some@@ body , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ve@@ ss@@ el , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the es@@ sen@@ ce and the s@@ our@@ ce of all di@@ v@@ ine , cre@@ ative , un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble , e@@ ter@@ n@@ al my@@ ster@@ y is just a s@@ mid@@ ge too much resp@@ on@@ si@@ bil@@ ity to put on one f@@ ra@@ g@@ ile , human p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e .
It &apos;s like as@@ king some@@ body to s@@ wal@@ low the su@@ n .
It just comple@@ tely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s , and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ a@@ ge@@ able exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
And I think the pre@@ ss@@ ure of that has been kil@@ ling off our arti@@ sts for the last 5@@ 00 years .
And , if this is tru@@ e , and I think it is tru@@ e , the question be@@ comes , what now ?
C@@ an we do this differ@@ en@@ tly ?
Ma@@ ybe go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent under@@ stand@@ ing about the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between hu@@ man@@ s and the cre@@ ative my@@ ster@@ y .
Ma@@ ybe not .
Ma@@ ybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 5@@ 00 years of r@@ ational hu@@ man@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 1@@ 8 minu@@ te spe@@ ec@@ h .
And there &apos;s probably people in this au@@ di@@ ence who would ra@@ i@@ se really le@@ g@@ it@@ im@@ ate sci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ons about the not@@ ion of , bas@@ ically , fa@@ ir@@ ies who f@@ ol@@ low people around ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing fa@@ ir@@ y ju@@ ice on their pro@@ jec@@ ts and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to br@@ ing you all al@@ ong with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to p@@ ose is --
you know , why not ?
Wh@@ y not think about it this way ?
Because it ma@@ kes as much sense as any@@ thing el@@ se I have ever he@@ ard in ter@@ ms of ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing the u@@ t@@ ter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ r@@ ici@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss of the cre@@ ative proc@@ ess .
A proc@@ ess which , as any@@ body who has ever tr@@ ied to make something -- which is to say bas@@ ically every@@ one here -@@ -- kno@@ ws does not always be@@ have r@@ ation@@ ally .
And , in fact , can some@@ times feel do@@ w@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al . I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ en@@ tly
where I met the ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary Amer@@ ic@@ an po@@ et R@@ u@@ th St@@ one ,
who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0@@ s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her enti@@ re life
and she t@@ old me that when she was gro@@ wing up in r@@ ur@@ al V@@ ir@@ gin@@ ia ,
she would be out working in the fi@@ el@@ ds , and she said she would feel and he@@ ar a p@@ oe@@ m coming at her from over the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of a@@ ir .
And it would come b@@ ar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
And she f@@ elt it coming , because it would s@@ ha@@ ke the e@@ arth un@@ der her fe@@ et . S@@ he k@@ new that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her wor@@ ds , &quot; ru@@ n like hel@@ l . &quot;
And she would ru@@ n like hel@@ l to the hou@@ se and she would be getting ch@@ as@@ ed by this p@@ oe@@ m , and the whole de@@ al was that she had to get to a pie@@ ce of p@@ ap@@ er and a pen@@ ci@@ l
fa@@ st enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could col@@ lec@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the pa@@ ge .
And other times she w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be fa@@ st enough ,
so she &apos;d be r@@ un@@ ning and r@@ un@@ ning , and she w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t get to the hou@@ se
and the p@@ oe@@ m would b@@ ar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would contin@@ ue on ac@@ ros@@ s the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is the pie@@ ce I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ents where she would al@@ most mis@@ s it , right ?
So , she &apos;s r@@ un@@ ning to the hou@@ se and she &apos;s looking for the p@@ ap@@ er and the p@@ oe@@ m pas@@ ses through her ,
and she gra@@ b@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it &apos;s going through her ,
and then she said , it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other hand and she would c@@ at@@ ch it .
S@@ he would c@@ at@@ ch the p@@ oe@@ m by its ta@@ il , and she would p@@ ul@@ l it bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds into her body as she was tr@@ an@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the pa@@ ge .
And in these in@@ stan@@ ces , the p@@ oe@@ m would come up on the pa@@ ge per@@ f@@ ect and in@@ t@@ act but bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds , from the last wor@@ d to the first .
So when I he@@ ard that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ c@@ an@@ n@@ y , that &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly what my cre@@ ative proc@@ ess is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my cre@@ ative proc@@ ess is -- I &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine !
I &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and s@@ we@@ at and la@@ b@@ or and b@@ ar@@ re@@ l through it really a@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly .
But even I , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ne@@ ss , even I have b@@ ru@@ s@@ he@@ d up aga@@ in@@ st that thing , at times .
And I would ima@@ g@@ ine that a lot of you have too . You know , even I have had work or ide@@ as come through me from a s@@ our@@ ce that I h@@ on@@ est@@ ly c@@ an@@ not i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us l@@ ose our min@@ ds ,
but , in fact , might actually ke@@ ep us s@@ an@@ e ?
And for me , the best con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the m@@ us@@ ici@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ its ,
who I got to inter@@ vie@@ w se@@ ver@@ al years ago on a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment .
And we were tal@@ king about this ,
and you know , T@@ om , for most of his life , he was pret@@ ty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the t@@ or@@ men@@ ted con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ary mo@@ der@@ n arti@@ st , trying to contro@@ l and man@@ age and d@@ om@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ contro@@ l@@ la@@ ble cre@@ ative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were tot@@ ally inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized .
But then he got ol@@ der , he got c@@ al@@ m@@ er ,
and one day he was dri@@ ving down the f@@ ree@@ way in L@@ o@@ s An@@ gel@@ es , and this is when it all chan@@ ged for him .
And he &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding al@@ ong , and all of a su@@ dden he he@@ ars this little f@@ ra@@ g@@ ment of m@@ el@@ o@@ dy ,
that comes into his he@@ ad as in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation of@@ ten comes , el@@ u@@ si@@ ve and t@@ an@@ tal@@ iz@@ ing ,
and he wan@@ ts it , it &apos;s g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous ,
and he l@@ on@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a pie@@ ce of p@@ ap@@ er , or a pen@@ ci@@ l , or a t@@ ap@@ e rec@@ or@@ der .
So he star@@ ts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty start to ri@@ se in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to l@@ ose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this s@@ ong for@@ ever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And in@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ an@@ ic@@ king , he just stop@@ p@@ ed . He just stop@@ p@@ ed that whole men@@ tal proc@@ ess and he did something comple@@ tely no@@ v@@ el .
He just loo@@ ked up at the sk@@ y , and he said , &quot; E@@ x@@ cu@@ se me , can you not see that I &apos;m dri@@ ving ? &quot;
&quot; D@@ o I look like I can wr@@ ite down a s@@ ong right now ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist , come back at a more op@@ port@@ un@@ e moment when I can take c@@ are of you .
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , go bo@@ ther some@@ body el@@ se today .
G@@ o bo@@ ther L@@ e@@ on@@ ard C@@ o@@ hen . &quot; And his whole work proc@@ ess chan@@ ged after that .
No@@ t the work , the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as d@@ ar@@ k as ever .
But the proc@@ ess , and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ ie@@ ty around it was rel@@ e@@ as@@ ed when he took the gen@@ ie , the gen@@ i@@ us out of him
where it was c@@ au@@ sing no@@ thing but tr@@ ou@@ ble , and rel@@ e@@ as@@ ed it back where it came from ,
and real@@ ized that this didn &apos;t have to be this inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized , t@@ or@@ men@@ ted thing .
It could be this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re col@@ la@@ bor@@ ation , kind of con@@ vers@@ ation between T@@ om and the str@@ an@@ ge , ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om .
When I he@@ ard that story , it started to shi@@ ft a little bit
the way that I wor@@ ked too , and this idea al@@ ready sa@@ ved me on@@ ce .
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the mid@@ d@@ le of wr@@ it@@ ing &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , L@@ o@@ ve , &quot;
and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of de@@ sp@@ a@@ ir
that we all f@@ all into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a di@@ sa@@ ster , the wor@@ st b@@ ook ever wr@@ itten .
No@@ t just b@@ ad , but the wor@@ st b@@ ook ever wr@@ itten .
And I started to think I should just du@@ m@@ p this project .
But then I re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om tal@@ king to the open a@@ ir and I tr@@ ied it .
So I just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ u@@ script and I direc@@ ted my com@@ ments to an em@@ p@@ ty cor@@ ner of the r@@ oom .
And I said al@@ oud , &quot; L@@ i@@ sten you , thing , you and I bot@@ h know that if this b@@ ook is@@ n &apos;t br@@ il@@ li@@ ant that is not enti@@ rel@@ y my fa@@ ul@@ t , right ?
Because you can see that I am pu@@ tting everything I have into this ,
I don &apos;t have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al .
But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hel@@ l with it .
I &apos;m going to ke@@ ep wr@@ it@@ ing any@@ way because that &apos;s my jo@@ b .
And I would p@@ lea@@ se like the rec@@ or@@ d to re@@ f@@ lec@@ t today that I sho@@ w@@ ed up for my part of the jo@@ b . &quot;
Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , OK --
cen@@ tur@@ ies ago in the de@@ ser@@ ts of N@@ or@@ th Africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and mu@@ sic
that would go on for h@@ our@@ s and h@@ our@@ s , un@@ ti@@ l da@@ wn .
They were always ma@@ g@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , because the d@@ anc@@ ers were pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion@@ als and they were ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ic , right ?
But every on@@ ce in a wh@@ ile , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happ@@ en ,
and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually be@@ come tr@@ an@@ sc@@ en@@ dent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m tal@@ king about , because I know you &apos;ve all s@@ een , at some point in your life ,
a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this . It was like time would st@@ op , and the d@@ anc@@ er would sort of ste@@ p through some kind of port@@ al
and he wa@@ sn &apos;t doing any@@ thing different than he had ever done , 1@@ ,000 ni@@ gh@@ ts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
And all of a su@@ dden , he would no l@@ on@@ ger ap@@ pe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human .
He would be l@@ it from with@@ in , and l@@ it from bel@@ ow
and all l@@ it up on fir@@ e with di@@ vin@@ ity .
And when this happened , back then , people k@@ new it for what it was , you know , they called it by its na@@ me . They would put their hand@@ s together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
C@@ ur@@ i@@ ous hi@@ stor@@ ical f@@ oo@@ t@@ not@@ e : when the M@@ oor@@ s in@@ va@@ ded s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them
and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation chan@@ ged over the cen@@ tur@@ ies from &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; O@@ l@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot;
which you still he@@ ar in b@@ ul@@ l@@ fi@@ gh@@ ts and in f@@ la@@ men@@ c@@ o dan@@ ces .
In S@@ pa@@ in , when a per@@ form@@ er has done something im@@ pos@@ sible and ma@@ gi@@ c , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , Al@@ la@@ h , ma@@ g@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , bra@@ v@@ o , &quot;
in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sible , there it is -- a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of God .
Wh@@ ich is great , because we need that .
But , the tr@@ ic@@ k@@ y bit comes the next mor@@ ning , for the d@@ anc@@ er hi@@ m@@ self , when he wa@@ kes up and disc@@ over@@ s that it &apos;s T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 1@@ 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no l@@ on@@ ger a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of God .
He &apos;s just an a@@ ging mor@@ tal with really b@@ ad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ i@@ ght again .
And maybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant God &apos;s na@@ me again as he sp@@ ins ,
and what is he then to do with the re@@ st of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so f@@ ul@@ l of an@@ gu@@ ish
if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary a@@ spec@@ ts of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just bel@@ ie@@ ved that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able s@@ our@@ ce for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life
to be pas@@ s@@ ed al@@ ong when you &apos;re fin@@ is@@ he@@ d , with some@@ body el@@ se .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it star@@ ts to change everything .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think ,
and this is cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few mon@@ th@@ s as I &apos;ve been working on the b@@ ook that will s@@ oon be pub@@ li@@ s@@ he@@ d ,
as the dan@@ ger@@ ous@@ ly , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing@@ ly over@@ -@@ an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated f@@ ol@@ low up

J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ hen : O@@ l@@ é !
You know , I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about some of these pro@@ jec@@ ts before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean , and disc@@ over@@ ing new se@@ ts of gen@@ es .
We &apos;re actually star@@ ting at a new point : we &apos;ve been dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing bi@@ olog@@ y , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that dig@@ it@@ al co@@ de into a new p@@ ha@@ se of bi@@ olog@@ y with desig@@ ning and sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ zing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to as@@ k big quest@@ i@@ ons .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ sts have been trying to understand at v@@ ari@@ ous le@@ vel@@ s .
We &apos;ve tr@@ ied v@@ ari@@ ous ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents .
We &apos;ve been dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing it now for al@@ most 20 years ;
when we se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ed the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of bi@@ olog@@ y into the dig@@ it@@ al world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to as@@ k , &quot; C@@ an we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this dig@@ it@@ al univer@@ se ? &quot;
This is the ma@@ p of a sm@@ all organis@@ m , M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ la@@ sm@@ a gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the sm@@ alle@@ st gen@@ ome for a spec@@ ies that can sel@@ f@@ -@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate in the la@@ bor@@ at@@ or@@ y ,
and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ all@@ er gen@@ ome .
We &apos;re able to kno@@ c@@ k out on the or@@ der of 100 gen@@ es out of the 5@@ 00 or so that are here .
When we look at its me@@ t@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c ma@@ p , it &apos;s rel@@ ati@@ vel@@ y simp@@ le comp@@ ar@@ ed to our@@ s --
tru@@ st me , this is simp@@ le --
but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ c@@ k out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ li@@ kel@@ y that this would y@@ i@@ eld a li@@ ving c@@ ell .
So we de@@ c@@ ide@@ d the only way for@@ ward was to actually sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ ze this ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to as@@ k some of these most fun@@ da@@ men@@ tal quest@@ i@@ ons .
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of : can we sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ ze a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome ?
C@@ an ch@@ e@@ mi@@ str@@ y per@@ m@@ it making these really lar@@ ge mo@@ le@@ cu@@ les where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we boo@@ t up a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome ?
A ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome , by the way , is just a pie@@ ce of in@@ ert ch@@ em@@ ical mater@@ ial .
So , our p@@ ace of dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al p@@ ace .
O@@ ur abil@@ ity to wr@@ ite the gene@@ tic co@@ de has been mo@@ ving pret@@ ty s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing ,
and our l@@ at@@ est point would put it on , now , an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al cur@@ ve .
We started this over 1@@ 5 years ago .
It took se@@ ver@@ al sta@@ ges , in fact , star@@ ting with a bi@@ oe@@ th@@ ical re@@ vie@@ w before we did the first experi@@ ments .
But it tur@@ ns out sy@@ n@@ the@@ si@@ zing D@@ N@@ A is very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t .
There are t@@ ens of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of mach@@ in@@ es around the world that make sm@@ all pie@@ ces of D@@ N@@ A -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in l@@ en@@ g@@ th -- and it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ate proc@@ ess , so the l@@ on@@ ger you make the pie@@ ce , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ od for pu@@ tting these little pie@@ ces together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the er@@ r@@ ors .
And this was our first at@@ te@@ mp@@ t , star@@ ting with the dig@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4 .
It &apos;s a sm@@ all vi@@ ru@@ s that kil@@ ls bac@@ ter@@ ia .
We desig@@ ned the pie@@ ces , went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ rec@@ tion
and had a D@@ N@@ A mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ters .
The ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing p@@ ha@@ se came when we took this pie@@ ce of in@@ ert ch@@ em@@ ical and put it in the bac@@ ter@@ ia , and the bac@@ ter@@ ia started to re@@ ad this gene@@ tic co@@ de , made the vir@@ al par@@ tic@@ les .
The vir@@ al par@@ tic@@ les then were rel@@ e@@ as@@ ed from the cel@@ ls and came back and kil@@ led the E@@ . col@@ i .
I was tal@@ king to the o@@ il indu@@ str@@ y rec@@ en@@ tly and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly under@@ st@@ ood that model .
They la@@ u@@ g@@ he@@ d more than you gu@@ ys are .
And so , we think this is a s@@ itu@@ ation where the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are can actually buil@@ d its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a bi@@ olog@@ ical system .
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger :
we wanted to buil@@ d the enti@@ re bac@@ ter@@ ial ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome --
it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ters of gene@@ tic co@@ de --
so we thought we &apos;d buil@@ d them in c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ tes the si@@ ze of the vi@@ ru@@ ses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ as@@ se@@ t@@ tes
to understand what the ac@@ tu@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents of a li@@ ving c@@ ell are .
De@@ sig@@ n is cr@@ it@@ ical , and if you &apos;re star@@ ting with dig@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation in the computer , that dig@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation has to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
When we first se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 19@@ 9@@ 5 , the stand@@ ard of ac@@ cur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ro@@ r per 1@@ 0@@ ,000 ba@@ se pa@@ ir@@ s .
We actually found , on re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that or@@ ig@@ in@@ al se@@ qu@@ ence , it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up .
P@@ art of the design is desig@@ ning pie@@ ces that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter pie@@ ces to buil@@ d sm@@ all@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
We design uni@@ qu@@ e ele@@ ments into this .
You may have re@@ ad that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in .
Th@@ in@@ k of this : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ let@@ ter gene@@ tic co@@ de -- A , C , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ ple@@ ts of those let@@ ters co@@ de for rou@@ gh@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids , s@@ uch that there &apos;s a s@@ ing@@ le let@@ ter desig@@ n@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids .
So we can use the gene@@ tic co@@ de to wr@@ ite out wor@@ ds , sen@@ ten@@ ces , thou@@ gh@@ ts .
In@@ iti@@ ally , all we did was au@@ to@@ grap@@ h it .
S@@ ome people were di@@ s@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted there was not p@@ oe@@ try .
We desig@@ ned these pie@@ ces so we can just ch@@ e@@ w back with en@@ z@@ y@@ mes ;
there are en@@ z@@ y@@ mes that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them together .
And we started making pie@@ ces , star@@ ting with pie@@ ces that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter pie@@ ces , then put se@@ ts of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000 .
A@@ t each sta@@ ge , we gre@@ w up these pie@@ ces in ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance so we could se@@ qu@@ ence them because we &apos;re trying to create a proc@@ ess that &apos;s ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a minu@@ te .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of au@@ t@@ om@@ ation .
So , this loo@@ ks like a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all pla@@ y@@ off .
When we get into these really lar@@ ge pie@@ ces over 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 ba@@ se pa@@ ir@@ s , they w@@ on &apos;t any l@@ on@@ ger gro@@ w re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i --
it ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sts all the mo@@ der@@ n t@@ oo@@ ls of mo@@ le@@ cu@@ lar bi@@ olog@@ y --
and so we tur@@ ned to other me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
We k@@ new there &apos;s a me@@ chan@@ is@@ m called h@@ om@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ bin@@ ation that bi@@ olog@@ y us@@ es to re@@ pa@@ ir D@@ N@@ A that can put pie@@ ces together .
Here &apos;s an example of it :
there &apos;s an organis@@ m called De@@ in@@ oc@@ oc@@ c@@ us ra@@ di@@ o@@ d@@ ur@@ ans that can take three mil@@ li@@ ons ra@@ ds of ra@@ di@@ ation .
You can see in the top p@@ an@@ el , its ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome just ge@@ ts b@@ lo@@ wn ap@@ art .
T@@ wel@@ ve to 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s later , it put it back together ex@@ ac@@ tly as it was before .
We have thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of organis@@ ms that can do this .
These organis@@ ms can be tot@@ ally de@@ s@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ;
they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um .
I am ab@@ solu@@ tely cer@@ ta@@ in that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter space , mo@@ ve around , find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
In fact , N@@ A@@ S@@ A has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there .
Here &apos;s an ac@@ tu@@ al m@@ ic@@ ro@@ grap@@ h of the mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le we buil@@ t using these proc@@ ess@@ es , actually just using ye@@ a@@ st me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pie@@ ces we put them in ;
ye@@ a@@ st pu@@ ts them together au@@ t@@ om@@ at@@ ically .
This is not an elec@@ tr@@ on m@@ ic@@ ro@@ grap@@ h ; this is just a re@@ gu@@ lar ph@@ ot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ grap@@ h .
It &apos;s s@@ uch a lar@@ ge mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le we can see it with a light m@@ ic@@ ros@@ c@@ op@@ e .
These are pic@@ tu@@ res over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second peri@@ od .
So , this is the pub@@ lic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ ort wh@@ ile ago .
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ters of gene@@ tic co@@ de ;
it &apos;s the lar@@ ge@@ st mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le ever made by hu@@ man@@ s of a de@@ fin@@ ed struc@@ ture .
It &apos;s over 3@@ 00 million mo@@ le@@ cu@@ lar we@@ i@@ ght .
If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no sp@@ ac@@ ing , it ta@@ kes 1@@ 4@@ 2 pa@@ ges just to pr@@ int this gene@@ tic co@@ de .
Well , how do we boo@@ t up a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome ? How do we acti@@ v@@ ate this ?
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly , with a vi@@ ru@@ s it &apos;s pret@@ ty simp@@ le ;
it &apos;s much more comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with bac@@ ter@@ ia .
It &apos;s also si@@ m@@ pl@@ er when you go into eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like our@@ selves : you can just p@@ op out the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us and p@@ op in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all he@@ ard about with cl@@ on@@ ing .
W@@ it@@ h bac@@ ter@@ ia and A@@ r@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the c@@ ell , but we rec@@ en@@ tly sho@@ w@@ ed that we can do a comple@@ te tr@@ an@@ sp@@ l@@ ant of a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome from one c@@ ell to another and acti@@ v@@ ate it .
We p@@ ur@@ i@@ f@@ ied a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome from one m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al spec@@ ies --
rou@@ gh@@ ly , these two are as di@@ st@@ ant as human and m@@ ice --
we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome ,
we di@@ ge@@ st@@ ed it with en@@ z@@ y@@ mes to k@@ ill all the prot@@ ein@@ s ,
and it was pret@@ ty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the c@@ ell -- and you &apos;ll app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate our very s@@ op@@ hi@@ st@@ ic@@ ated grap@@ h@@ ics here . The new ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome went into the c@@ ell .
In fact , we thought this might be as f@@ ar as it went , but we tr@@ ied to design the proc@@ ess a little bit f@@ ur@@ ther .
This is a ma@@ j@@ or me@@ chan@@ is@@ m of evolu@@ tion right here .
We find all kin@@ ds of spec@@ ies that have ta@@ ken up a second ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome or a th@@ ir@@ d one from some@@ where , ad@@ ding thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of new tra@@ its in a second to that spec@@ ies .
So , people who think of evolu@@ tion as just one gen@@ e chan@@ ging at a time have mis@@ s@@ ed much of bi@@ olog@@ y .
There are en@@ z@@ y@@ mes called re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion en@@ z@@ y@@ mes that actually di@@ ge@@ st D@@ N@@ A .
The ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome that was in the c@@ ell doesn &apos;t have one ;
the ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome we put in does .
It got ex@@ pre@@ ss@@ ed and it rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ed the other ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome as for@@ ei@@ g@@ n mater@@ ial , ch@@ e@@ w@@ ed it up , and so we en@@ ded up just with a c@@ ell with the new ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome .
It tur@@ ned bl@@ ue because of the gen@@ es we put in it .
And with a very sh@@ ort peri@@ od of time , all the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of one spec@@ ies were l@@ ost and it con@@ ver@@ ted tot@@ ally into the new spec@@ ies bas@@ ed on the new s@@ of@@ tw@@ are that we put in the c@@ ell .
A@@ ll the prot@@ ein@@ s chan@@ ged , the me@@ m@@ br@@ an@@ es chan@@ ged ; when we re@@ ad the gene@@ tic co@@ de , it &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly what we had trans@@ f@@ er@@ red in .
So , this may s@@ ound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ ch@@ e@@ my , but we can , by mo@@ ving the s@@ of@@ tw@@ are of D@@ N@@ A around , change things quite dra@@ mat@@ ically .
Now I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half bil@@ lion years of evolu@@ tion . And I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to per@@ h@@ ap@@ s create a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ am@@ b@@ ri@@ an ex@@ pl@@ os@@ ion , where there &apos;s ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve new speci@@ ation bas@@ ed on this dig@@ it@@ al design .
Wh@@ y do this ?
I think this is pret@@ ty ob@@ vi@@ ous in ter@@ ms of some of the ne@@ eds .
We &apos;re about to go from si@@ x and a half to n@@ ine bil@@ lion people over the next 4@@ 0 years .
T@@ o put it in con@@ te@@ xt for my@@ self : I was bor@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
There are now three people on the plan@@ et
for every one of us that ex@@ ist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; with@@ in 4@@ 0 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ e@@ ding , pro@@ vi@@ ding f@@ res@@ h , c@@ le@@ an water , me@@ dic@@ in@@ es , fu@@ el for the si@@ x and a half bil@@ lion .
It &apos;s going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine .
We use over five bil@@ lion t@@ ons of co@@ al , 30 bil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ pl@@ us b@@ ar@@ rel@@ s of o@@ il --
that &apos;s a h@@ un@@ d@@ red million b@@ ar@@ rel@@ s a day .
When we try to think of bi@@ olog@@ ical proc@@ ess@@ es or any proc@@ ess to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a hu@@ ge ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
Th@@ en of course , there &apos;s all that C@@ O@@ 2 from this mater@@ ial that en@@ ds up in the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here .
We now , from our disc@@ o@@ very around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es , and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ents of the fu@@ ture .
The elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics indu@@ str@@ y only had a do@@ zen or so comp@@ on@@ ents , and look at the di@@ vers@@ ity that came out of that .
We &apos;re lim@@ ited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a bi@@ olog@@ ical real@@ ity and our ima@@ gin@@ ation .
We now have tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , because of these r@@ ap@@ id me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of sy@@ n@@ the@@ s@@ is , to do what we &apos;re c@@ all@@ ing com@@ bin@@ at@@ or@@ ial gen@@ om@@ ics .
We have the abil@@ ity now to buil@@ d a lar@@ ge ro@@ bo@@ t that can make a million ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ es a day .
When you think of proc@@ ess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze proc@@ ess@@ es to produc@@ e oc@@ t@@ an@@ e or to produc@@ e ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , new v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es , we can just with a sm@@ all te@@ am , do more mo@@ le@@ cu@@ lar bi@@ olog@@ y than the last 20 years of all sci@@ ence .
And it &apos;s just stand@@ ard sel@@ ec@@ tion :
we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ abil@@ ity , ch@@ em@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion , v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine produc@@ tion , et@@ c .
This is a sc@@ re@@ en sn@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some tru@@ e design s@@ of@@ tw@@ are that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to s@@ it down and design spec@@ ies in the computer .
You know , we don &apos;t know nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily what it &apos;ll look like :
we know ex@@ ac@@ tly what their gene@@ tic co@@ de loo@@ ks like .
We &apos;re f@@ oc@@ using on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els .
You &apos;ve s@@ een rec@@ en@@ tly , cor@@ n to e@@ th@@ an@@ o@@ l is just a b@@ ad experi@@ ment .
We have sec@@ on@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els that will be coming out rel@@ ati@@ vel@@ y s@@ oon that are su@@ ga@@ r , to much hi@@ gh@@ er@@ -@@ val@@ ue fu@@ els like oc@@ t@@ an@@ e or different typ@@ es of bu@@ t@@ an@@ o@@ l .
But the only way we think that bi@@ olog@@ y can have a ma@@ j@@ or imp@@ act with@@ out f@@ ur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the c@@ ost of food and lim@@ it@@ ing its a@@ va@@ il@@ abil@@ ity is if we start with C@@ O@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ st@@ oc@@ k , and so we &apos;re working with desig@@ ning cel@@ ls to go down this ro@@ ad . And we think we &apos;ll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els in about 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ s .
S@@ un@@ light and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ od ... but in our disc@@ o@@ very around the world , we have all kin@@ ds of other me@@ th@@ o@@ ds .
This is an organis@@ m we de@@ scri@@ be@@ d in 19@@ 9@@ 6 .
It li@@ ves in the de@@ ep oce@@ an , about a mil@@ e and a half de@@ ep , al@@ most at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res .
It ta@@ kes C@@ O@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ an@@ e using mo@@ le@@ cu@@ lar hy@@ d@@ ro@@ gen as its energy s@@ our@@ ce .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red C@@ O@@ 2 , which can e@@ as@@ ily be pi@@ p@@ ed to s@@ it@@ es , con@@ ver@@ t that C@@ O@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to dri@@ ve this proc@@ ess .
So , in a sh@@ ort peri@@ od of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the ba@@ sic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot;
We tru@@ ly , you know , have mo@@ de@@ st go@@ als of re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l@@ -@@ ch@@ em@@ ical indu@@ str@@ y --
Y@@ ea@@ h . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? --
be@@ come a ma@@ j@@ or s@@ our@@ ce of energy ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same t@@ oo@@ ls to come up with inst@@ ant se@@ ts of v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es .
You &apos;ve s@@ een this year with fl@@ u ; we &apos;re always a year be@@ h@@ ind and a dollar sh@@ ort when it comes to the right v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine .
I think that can be chan@@ ged by building com@@ bin@@ at@@ or@@ ial v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es in ad@@ van@@ ce .
Here &apos;s what the fu@@ ture may begin to look like with chan@@ ging , now , the evolu@@ tion@@ ary tre@@ e , spe@@ e@@ ding up evolu@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic bac@@ ter@@ ia , A@@ r@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a and , e@@ ven@@ tually , eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
We &apos;re a ways away from im@@ pro@@ ving people :
our go@@ al is just to make s@@ ure that we have a chan@@ ce to sur@@ vi@@ ve long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly as I can , is some f@@ oun@@ d@@ ational work , some new technology that we br@@ ou@@ ght to M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t as part of an ac@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ion al@@ most ex@@ ac@@ tly a year ago .
This is S@@ e@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment in which you can ei@@ ther loc@@ ally or re@@ mot@@ ely inter@@ act with va@@ st am@@ oun@@ ts of vis@@ u@@ al data .
We &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of dig@@ it@@ al ph@@ oto@@ s here and kind of se@@ am@@ le@@ ss@@ ly and contin@@ u@@ ous@@ ly z@@ oo@@ ming in , p@@ an@@ ning through it , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
And it doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter how much inform@@ ation we &apos;re looking at , how big these col@@ lec@@ tions are or how big the ima@@ ges are .
M@@ ost of them are or@@ din@@ ary dig@@ it@@ al cam@@ er@@ a ph@@ oto@@ s , but this one , for example , is a s@@ can from the L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of C@@ on@@ gre@@ ss , and it &apos;s in the 3@@ 00 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el ran@@ ge .
It doesn &apos;t make any differ@@ ence because the only thing that ou@@ ght to lim@@ it the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your sc@@ re@@ en at any gi@@ ven moment .
It &apos;s also very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble arch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture .
This is an enti@@ re b@@ ook , so this is an example of n@@ on@@ -@@ ima@@ ge data .
This is &quot; B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ou@@ se &quot; by D@@ ic@@ k@@ ens . E@@ very col@@ u@@ m@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter .
T@@ o pro@@ ve to you that it &apos;s really te@@ xt , and not an ima@@ ge , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real re@@ presen@@ t@@ ation of the te@@ xt ; it &apos;s not a pic@@ ture .
Ma@@ ybe this is an arti@@ fic@@ ial way to re@@ ad an e-@@ b@@ ook .
I w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
This is a more real@@ ist@@ ic ca@@ se , an is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
E@@ very lar@@ ge ima@@ ge is the begin@@ ning of a sec@@ tion .
And this really gi@@ ves you the jo@@ y and the good experi@@ ence of re@@ a@@ ding the real p@@ ap@@ er ver@@ sion of a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , which is an in@@ her@@ en@@ tly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ sc@@ ale kind of me@@ di@@ um .
We &apos;ve done something with the cor@@ ner of this parti@@ cu@@ lar is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
We &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very hi@@ gh re@@ solu@@ tion -- much hi@@ gh@@ er than in an or@@ din@@ ary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded ex@@ tr@@ a cont@@ ent .
If you want to see the fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of this c@@ ar , you can see it here .
O@@ r other mo@@ del@@ s , or even tech@@ n@@ ical speci@@ fic@@ ations .
And this really ge@@ ts at some of these ide@@ as about really doing away with those lim@@ its on sc@@ re@@ en real est@@ ate .
We hop@@ e that this me@@ ans no more pop@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish like that -- sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be nec@@ ess@@ ary .
O@@ f course , m@@ app@@ ing is one of those ob@@ vi@@ ous app@@ lic@@ ations for a technology like this . And this one I really w@@ on &apos;t sp@@ end any time on , ex@@ cep@@ t to say that we have things to cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ te to this fi@@ eld as well .
But those are all the ro@@ a@@ ds in the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
su@@ per@@ im@@ pos@@ ed on top of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ os@@ p@@ ati@@ al ima@@ ge .
So let &apos;s p@@ ul@@ l up , now , something el@@ se .
This is actually live on the W@@ e@@ b now ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it out .
This is a project called P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th , which mar@@ r@@ ies two different technolog@@ ies .
One of them is S@@ e@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beau@@ ti@@ ful compu@@ ter@@ -@@ vi@@ sion re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch done by No@@ a@@ h S@@ na@@ vel@@ y , a gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dent at the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by S@@ te@@ ve S@@ e@@ it@@ z at U@@ .@@ W@@ .
and R@@ ick S@@ zel@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch . A very n@@ ice col@@ la@@ bor@@ ation .
And so this is live on the W@@ e@@ b . It &apos;s po@@ wer@@ ed by S@@ e@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through ima@@ ges and have this kind of m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ re@@ solu@@ tion experi@@ ence .
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment of the ima@@ ges here is actually me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful .
The computer vi@@ sion al@@ g@@ or@@ i@@ th@@ ms have re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed these ima@@ ges together so that they cor@@ resp@@ ond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all ta@@ ken ne@@ ar G@@ ra@@ ss@@ i La@@ kes in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were ta@@ ken . So you see ele@@ ments here of st@@ ab@@ ili@@ z@@ ed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or p@@ an@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally .
I &apos;m not s@@ ure if I have time to show you any other en@@ vir@@ on@@ ments .
S@@ ome are much more sp@@ ati@@ al .
I would like to ju@@ m@@ p stra@@ i@@ ght to one of No@@ a@@ h &apos;s or@@ ig@@ in@@ al dat@@ a@@ -@@ se@@ ts -- this is from an ear@@ ly prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e that we first got working this su@@ mm@@ er -- to show you what I think is really the pun@@ ch line be@@ h@@ ind the P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th technology , It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily so app@@ ar@@ ent from looking at the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ments we &apos;ve put up on the we@@ b@@ s@@ ite .
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on .
This is a re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ a@@ me C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done enti@@ rel@@ y compu@@ t@@ ation@@ ally from ima@@ ges sc@@ r@@ ap@@ ed from F@@ lic@@ k@@ r . You just typ@@ e N@@ ot@@ re D@@ a@@ me into F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , and you get some pic@@ tu@@ res of gu@@ ys in T@@ -@@ shi@@ r@@ ts , and of the cam@@ p@@ us and so on .
And each of these or@@ an@@ ge con@@ es re@@ presen@@ ts an ima@@ ge that was disc@@ over@@ ed to bel@@ ong to this model .
And so these are all F@@ lic@@ k@@ r ima@@ ges , and they &apos;ve all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way .
We can just na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate in this very simp@@ le way .
You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t .
It &apos;s very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here .
I gu@@ ess you can see this is l@@ ots of different typ@@ es of cam@@ er@@ as : it &apos;s everything from cel@@ l@@ -@@ ph@@ one cam@@ er@@ as to pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s , quite a lar@@ ge number of them , st@@ it@@ ch@@ ed together in this en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ir@@ d ones --
So many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by fac@@ es , and so on .
S@@ ome@@ where in here there is actually a ser@@ ies of ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ h@@ s -- here we go .
This is actually a po@@ ster of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ a@@ me that re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
We can di@@ ve in from the po@@ ster to a ph@@ ys@@ ical vie@@ w of this en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the soc@@ ial en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment . This is now ta@@ king data from every@@ body -- from the enti@@ re col@@ lec@@ tive me@@ mor@@ y , vis@@ u@@ ally , of what the Earth loo@@ ks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together .
Th@@ ose ph@@ oto@@ s be@@ come lin@@ ked , and they make something em@@ er@@ gen@@ t that &apos;s gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts .
You have a model that em@@ er@@ ges of the enti@@ re Earth .
Th@@ in@@ k of this as the long ta@@ il to S@@ te@@ ph@@ en La@@ w@@ l@@ er &apos;s V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al Earth work .
And this is something that gro@@ ws in comple@@ x@@ ity as people use it , and wh@@ ose ben@@ ef@@ its be@@ come gre@@ ater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
The@@ ir own ph@@ oto@@ s are getting ta@@ g@@ ged with me@@ ta@@ -@@ data that some@@ body el@@ se en@@ ter@@ ed .
If some@@ body bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my p@@ ho@@ to of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ a@@ me C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ge@@ ts en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ed with all of that data , and I can use it as an en@@ try point to di@@ ve into that space , into that me@@ ta@@ -@@ ver@@ se , using every@@ body el@@ se &apos;s ph@@ oto@@ s , and do a kind of a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ mo@@ d@@ al and cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ us@@ er soc@@ ial experi@@ ence that way .
And of course , a b@@ y@@ -@@ produc@@ t of all of that is im@@ mensel@@ y r@@ ich vir@@ tu@@ al mo@@ del@@ s of every interesting part of the Earth , col@@ lec@@ ted not just from over@@ he@@ ad f@@ li@@ gh@@ ts and from s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ e ima@@ ges and so on , but from the col@@ lec@@ tive me@@ mor@@ y .
Thank you so much .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : D@@ o I understand this right ? What your s@@ of@@ tw@@ are is going to al@@ low , is that at some point , really with@@ in the next few years , all the pic@@ tu@@ res that are sh@@ ar@@ ed by any@@ one ac@@ ros@@ s the world are going to lin@@ k together ?
B@@ A@@ A : Y@@ es . What this is really doing is disc@@ over@@ ing ,
cre@@ ating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between ima@@ ges .
It &apos;s doing that bas@@ ed on the cont@@ ent in@@ side the ima@@ ges .
And that ge@@ ts really ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ ne@@ ss of the se@@ man@@ tic inform@@ ation a lot of ima@@ ges have .
L@@ i@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ ar@@ ch for ima@@ ges , you typ@@ e in ph@@ ra@@ ses , and the te@@ xt on the we@@ b pa@@ ge is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of inform@@ ation
about what that pic@@ ture is of .
What if that pic@@ ture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tu@@ res ? The am@@ oun@@ t of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ con@@ nec@@ tion and ri@@ ch@@ ne@@ ss that comes out of that is really hu@@ ge . It &apos;s a c@@ la@@ s@@ sic net@@ work eff@@ ect .
C@@ A : T@@ ru@@ ly incre@@ di@@ ble . C@@ on@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations .
You know , one of the in@@ ten@@ se ple@@ as@@ u@@ res of tra@@ v@@ el and one of the del@@ i@@ gh@@ ts of e@@ th@@ no@@ grap@@ hi@@ c re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch is the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to live am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their pa@@ st in the w@@ ind , t@@ ou@@ ch it in st@@ ones po@@ li@@ s@@ he@@ d by ra@@ in , ta@@ ste it in the b@@ it@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts .
J@@ ust to know that J@@ a@@ gu@@ ar s@@ ha@@ man@@ s still j@@ our@@ ne@@ y be@@ y@@ ond the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ th@@ s of the In@@ uit el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a , the B@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ hi@@ sts still p@@ ur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ at@@ h of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really re@@ me@@ mber the cen@@ tr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ y , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some ab@@ solu@@ te sense , but is just one model of real@@ ity ,
the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of one parti@@ cu@@ lar set of ad@@ ap@@ tive ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it succ@@ ess@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , many gener@@ ations ago .
And of course , we all sh@@ are the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves . We &apos;re all bor@@ n . We all br@@ ing our children into the world .
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation r@@ it@@ es .
We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ at@@ h ,
so it sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t sur@@ pri@@ se us that we all sing , we all d@@ ance , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ qu@@ e ca@@ den@@ ce of the s@@ ong , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every cul@@ ture .
And w@@ he@@ ther it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in H@@ a@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut de@@ ser@@ t of N@@ or@@ ther@@ n K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ a@@ van@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the mid@@ d@@ le of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a -- this is in@@ ci@@ den@@ t@@ ally the f@@ el@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the de@@ ser@@ t with a m@@ ont@@ h ago -- or in@@ deed a y@@ a@@ k her@@ der in the sl@@ op@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ an@@ g@@ ma ,
E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss mo@@ ther of the world .
A@@ ll of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of or@@ i@@ en@@ ting y@@ our@@ self in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hop@@ e .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tu@@ res of the world make up a we@@ b of sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al life and cul@@ tur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the plan@@ et , and is as important to the wel@@ l@@ -@@ being of the plan@@ et as in@@ deed is the bi@@ olog@@ ical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ p@@ here .
And you might think of this cul@@ tur@@ al we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here ,
and you might de@@ f@@ ine the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here as being the su@@ m tot@@ al of all thou@@ gh@@ ts and dre@@ am@@ s , my@@ th@@ s , ide@@ as , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ations , in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ons br@@ ou@@ ght into being by the human ima@@ gin@@ ation sin@@ ce the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss .
The e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here is hu@@ man@@ ity &apos;s great le@@ g@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ ve spec@@ ies .
And just as the bi@@ os@@ p@@ here has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here -- and , if any@@ thing , at a f@@ ar gre@@ ater r@@ ate .
No bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ sts , for example , would d@@ are su@@ g@@ ge@@ st that 50 percent of all spec@@ ies or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion because it simp@@ ly is not tru@@ e ,
and y@@ et that -- the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o sc@@ ar@@ cel@@ y ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity .
And the great in@@ dic@@ at@@ or of that , of course , is lan@@ gu@@ age los@@ s .
When each of you in this r@@ oom were bor@@ n , there were 6@@ ,000 lan@@ gu@@ a@@ ges sp@@ o@@ ken on the plan@@ et .
Now , a lan@@ gu@@ age is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ mat@@ ical ru@@ les .
A lan@@ gu@@ age is a f@@ la@@ sh of the human sp@@ ir@@ it .
It &apos;s a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each parti@@ cu@@ lar cul@@ ture comes into the mater@@ ial world .
E@@ very lan@@ gu@@ age is an ol@@ d@@ -@@ gro@@ w@@ th for@@ est of the m@@ ind , a wat@@ er@@ s@@ he@@ d , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ ste@@ m of sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities .
And of those 6@@ ,000 lan@@ gu@@ a@@ ges , as we s@@ it here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , f@@ ul@@ ly half are no l@@ on@@ ger being wh@@ i@@ sp@@ er@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
They &apos;re no l@@ on@@ ger being t@@ au@@ ght to b@@ ab@@ ies ,
which me@@ ans , eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y , un@@ less something chan@@ ges , they &apos;re al@@ ready de@@ ad .
What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in s@@ il@@ ence , to be the last of your people to sp@@ ea@@ k your lan@@ gu@@ age , to have no way to pas@@ s on the wis@@ d@@ om of the anc@@ est@@ ors or an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the pr@@ om@@ i@@ se of the children ?
And y@@ et , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ deed the p@@ light of some@@ body some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two we@@ e@@ ks , because every two we@@ e@@ ks , some el@@ der di@@ es and car@@ r@@ ies with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ la@@ b@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent ton@@ gu@@ e .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t it be better , w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one lan@@ gu@@ age ? &quot; And I say , &quot; G@@ re@@ at , let &apos;s make that lan@@ gu@@ age Yor@@ ub@@ a . L@@ et &apos;s make it C@@ an@@ ton@@ e@@ se .
L@@ et &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot; And you &apos;ll su@@ d@@ den@@ ly disc@@ over what it would be like to be un@@ able to sp@@ ea@@ k your own lan@@ gu@@ age .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here , a br@@ ief j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being l@@ ost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
T@@ a@@ ke , for example , this chil@@ d of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the N@@ or@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ d@@ a who believe that my@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the ea@@ st in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ na@@ kes .
Now , this is a people who c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ vel@@ y do not di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ ish the col@@ or bl@@ ue from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the c@@ an@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is e@@ qu@@ ated to the c@@ an@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people de@@ p@@ end .
They have a cur@@ i@@ ous lan@@ gu@@ age and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; l@@ ing@@ u@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you m@@ ust mar@@ ry some@@ one who sp@@ ea@@ ks a different lan@@ gu@@ age .
And this is all r@@ oo@@ ted in the my@@ th@@ olog@@ ical pa@@ st , y@@ et the cur@@ i@@ ous thing is in these long hou@@ ses , where there are si@@ x or se@@ ven lan@@ gu@@ a@@ ges sp@@ o@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never he@@ ar any@@ one pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a lan@@ gu@@ age .
They simp@@ ly li@@ sten and then begin to sp@@ ea@@ k .
O@@ r , one of the most f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating tri@@ be@@ s I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8 .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies at@@ te@@ mp@@ ted cont@@ act and made a cr@@ it@@ ical mi@@ sta@@ ke .
They d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed from the a@@ ir 8 x 10 g@@ los@@ s@@ y ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ h@@ s of the@@ m@@ selves in what we would say to be fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly ge@@ stu@@ res , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never s@@ een any@@ thing tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al in their li@@ ves .
They pic@@ ked up these ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ h@@ s from the for@@ est fl@@ oor , tr@@ ied to look be@@ h@@ ind the face to find the form or the fig@@ ure ,
found no@@ thing , and con@@ clu@@ ded that these were c@@ all@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to de@@ at@@ h .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders . They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ aring each other .
We tr@@ ac@@ ed gene@@ al@@ og@@ ies back ei@@ ght gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ stan@@ ces of nat@@ ur@@ al de@@ at@@ h
and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he di@@ ed getting old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him any@@ way . But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of the for@@ est that was a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing .
The@@ ir h@@ un@@ ters could sm@@ ell anim@@ al ur@@ ine at 4@@ 0 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what spec@@ ies le@@ ft it be@@ h@@ ind .
In the ear@@ ly &apos; 8@@ 0@@ s , I had a really a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment when I was as@@ ked by my pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interest@@ ed in going down to H@@ a@@ it@@ i , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ r@@ et soc@@ ie@@ ties which were the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of D@@ u@@ val@@ ier &apos;s str@@ en@@ g@@ th and T@@ ont@@ on M@@ ac@@ ou@@ tes , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ b@@ ies .
In or@@ der to make sense out of sen@@ s@@ ation , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mar@@ k@@ able fa@@ it@@ h of V@@ o@@ d@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a bl@@ ack ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t .
O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a comple@@ x me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ ys@@ ical wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ w . It &apos;s interesting .
If I as@@ ked you to na@@ me the great rel@@ i@@ gi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ i@@ an@@ ity , I@@ sla@@ m , B@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ is@@ m , J@@ u@@ da@@ is@@ m , wh@@ at@@ ever .
There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent le@@ ft out , the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa had no rel@@ i@@ gi@@ ous bel@@ ie@@ f@@ s . Well , of course , they did
and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simp@@ ly the di@@ st@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found rel@@ i@@ gi@@ ous ide@@ as that came over d@@ ur@@ ing the tra@@ gi@@ c D@@ i@@ a@@ sp@@ or@@ a of the sla@@ very er@@ a .
But , what ma@@ kes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this li@@ ving rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the li@@ ving and the de@@ ad .
So , the li@@ ving give b@@ ir@@ th to the sp@@ ir@@ its .
The sp@@ ir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ at@@ h the G@@ re@@ at W@@ ater , resp@@ on@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ en@@ t@@ ar@@ ily di@@ sp@@ l@@ ace the s@@ ou@@ l of the li@@ ving , so that for that br@@ ief sh@@ in@@ ing moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ d@@ oo@@ ist@@ s like to say that &quot; You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and sp@@ ea@@ k about God .
We d@@ ance in the te@@ mp@@ le and be@@ come God . &quot; And because you are pos@@ se@@ ss@@ ed , you are ta@@ ken by the sp@@ ir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ m@@ ed ?
So you see these a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ations : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a st@@ ate of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ b@@ ers with im@@ pun@@ ity ,
a ra@@ ther a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the abil@@ ity of the m@@ ind to a@@ ff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the st@@ ate of ex@@ tre@@ me ex@@ c@@ it@@ ation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a Ne@@ v@@ ad@@ a de S@@ an@@ t@@ a M@@ ar@@ t@@ a in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a .
De@@ sc@@ en@@ dan@@ ts of the an@@ ci@@ ent T@@ a@@ ir@@ on@@ a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation which on@@ ce car@@ pe@@ ted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ a@@ st@@ al pla@@ in of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ qu@@ est ,
these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ c@@ an@@ ic ma@@ s@@ si@@ f that s@@ o@@ ars ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ a@@ st@@ al pla@@ in .
In a bl@@ oo@@ d@@ sta@@ in@@ ed contin@@ ent , these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish .
T@@ o this day , they re@@ ma@@ in ru@@ led by a r@@ itu@@ al pr@@ ie@@ s@@ th@@ ood but the tra@@ in@@ ing for the pr@@ ie@@ s@@ th@@ ood is ra@@ ther ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary .
The y@@ oun@@ g ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are ta@@ ken away from their fam@@ il@@ ies at the age of three and four ,
se@@ quest@@ er@@ ed in a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of d@@ ar@@ k@@ ne@@ ss in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the ba@@ se of g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 1@@ 8 years :
two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ o@@ ds del@@ i@@ ber@@ at@@ ely ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine mon@@ th@@ s of ge@@ st@@ ation they sp@@ end in their nat@@ ur@@ al mo@@ ther &apos;s w@@ om@@ b ;
now they are me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ically in the w@@ om@@ b of the great mo@@ ther .
And for this enti@@ re time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ u@@ es of their soc@@ ie@@ ty , val@@ u@@ es that ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the pro@@ pos@@ it@@ ion that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the c@@ os@@ mi@@ c -- or we might say the ec@@ olog@@ ical -- b@@ al@@ ance .
And at the end of this a@@ ma@@ zing in@@ iti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ta@@ ken out and for the first time in their li@@ ves , at the age of 1@@ 8 , they see a s@@ un@@ ri@@ se . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un begin@@ s to ba@@ the the sl@@ op@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beau@@ ti@@ ful land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly everything they have lear@@ ned in the ab@@ str@@ act is a@@ ff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning g@@ l@@ or@@ y . And the pr@@ ie@@ st ste@@ ps back
and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve t@@ old you .
It is that beau@@ ti@@ ful . It is y@@ our@@ s to prot@@ ect . &quot; They call the@@ m@@ selves the &quot; el@@ der bro@@ th@@ ers &quot;
and they say we , who are the y@@ oun@@ ger bro@@ th@@ ers , are the ones resp@@ on@@ sible for de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying the world .
Now , this lev@@ el of in@@ tu@@ it@@ ion be@@ comes very important .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , we ei@@ ther in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old c@@ an@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ va@@ ge , &quot; which is an idea r@@ ac@@ ist in its simp@@ lic@@ ity ,
or al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ vel@@ y , we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ or@@ ea@@ u and say these people are c@@ los@@ er to the Earth than we are .
Well , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ men@@ tal no@@ r we@@ a@@ ken@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
There &apos;s not a lot of r@@ oom for ei@@ ther in the m@@ al@@ ari@@ al s@@ wa@@ mp@@ s of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ b@@ et , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , through time and r@@ itu@@ al , for@@ ged a tra@@ di@@ tion@@ al my@@ st@@ i@@ qu@@ e of the Earth that is bas@@ ed not on the idea of being sel@@ f@@ -@@ con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ly cl@@ ose to it , but on a f@@ ar sub@@ t@@ l@@ er in@@ tu@@ it@@ ion : the idea that the Earth it@@ self can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss .
Now , what does that mean ? It me@@ ans that a y@@ oun@@ g k@@ id from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in is an A@@ p@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her de@@ st@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ f@@ oun@@ d@@ ly different human being and have a different rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to that res@@ our@@ ce or that place than a y@@ oun@@ g k@@ id from M@@ ont@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in is a p@@ ile of ro@@ c@@ k ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a p@@ ile of ore is ir@@ rel@@ e@@ v@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or that de@@ fin@@ es the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the indivi@@ du@@ al and the nat@@ ur@@ al world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ r@@ it@@ ish C@@ ol@@ u@@ m@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ est@@ s ex@@ ist@@ ed to be c@@ ut .
That made me a different human being than my fri@@ en@@ ds am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ est@@ s were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ r@@ oo@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of H@@ ea@@ ven and the c@@ an@@ ni@@ b@@ al sp@@ ir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the nor@@ th end of the world ,
sp@@ ir@@ its they would have to en@@ ga@@ ge d@@ ur@@ ing their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a in@@ iti@@ ation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cul@@ tu@@ res could create different real@@ ities , you could begin to understand some of their ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary disc@@ over@@ ies . T@@ a@@ ke this pl@@ ant here .
It &apos;s a ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ h I took in the N@@ or@@ th@@ we@@ st A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l .
This is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a , which many of you have he@@ ard about , the most po@@ wer@@ ful p@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ acti@@ ve pre@@ par@@ ation of the s@@ ha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
What ma@@ kes a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating is not the s@@ he@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ olog@@ ical p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different s@@ our@@ ces :
on the one hand , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a ser@@ ies of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es , har@@ m@@ ine , har@@ m@@ al@@ ine , mil@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is ra@@ ther to have sort of bl@@ ue ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft ac@@ ros@@ s your con@@ sci@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss --
but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e fam@@ ily called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
This pl@@ ant had in it some very po@@ wer@@ ful tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es , very cl@@ ose to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
If you &apos;ve ever s@@ een the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i b@@ lo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of spec@@ ies also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
T@@ o have that po@@ w@@ der b@@ lo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is ra@@ ther like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le b@@ ar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with b@@ ar@@ o@@ qu@@ e pa@@ in@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a se@@ a of elec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity . It doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of real@@ ity ; it cre@@ ates the di@@ ss@@ ol@@ u@@ tion of real@@ ity .
In fact , I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or , Ri@@ ch@@ ard E@@ van S@@ h@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e@@ del@@ ic er@@ a with his disc@@ o@@ very of the ma@@ gi@@ c mu@@ sh@@ r@@ oo@@ ms in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s --
I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you cou@@ ldn &apos;t c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re un@@ der the eff@@ ec@@ ts there &apos;s no one h@@ ome any@@ more to experi@@ ence a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation . But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es is they c@@ an@@ not be ta@@ ken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ i@@ da@@ se .
They can only be ta@@ ken or@@ ally if ta@@ ken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other ch@@ em@@ ical that den@@ at@@ u@@ res the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es found with@@ in that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ors of the pre@@ ci@@ se sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine . So you as@@ k y@@ our@@ self a question . How , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 spec@@ ies of v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar plan@@ ts , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated plan@@ ts that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this way , cre@@ ated a kind of bi@@ o@@ ch@@ em@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts ?
Well , we use that great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less .
But you as@@ k the In@@ di@@ ans , and they say , &quot; The plan@@ ts talk to us . &quot; Well , what does that mean ? This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a , all of which they di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ ish a great di@@ st@@ ance in the for@@ est , all of which are re@@ f@@ er@@ able to our ey@@ e as one spec@@ ies .
And then you as@@ k them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh their ta@@ x@@ onom@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you k@@ new something about plan@@ ts .
I mean , don &apos;t you know any@@ thing ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it tur@@ ns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties in the ni@@ ght of a f@@ ul@@ l m@@ oon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different ke@@ y .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting sta@@ men@@ s .
Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people vie@@ w them as qu@@ a@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ gin@@ s of hi@@ story as the real world , me@@ an@@ ing our world , mo@@ ves on .
Well , the tru@@ th is the 20@@ th cen@@ tur@@ y , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed for its w@@ ars or its technolog@@ ical in@@ no@@ v@@ ations , but ra@@ ther as the er@@ a in which we st@@ ood by and ei@@ ther acti@@ vel@@ y en@@ d@@ or@@ s@@ ed or pas@@ si@@ vel@@ y ac@@ cep@@ ted the ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve de@@ struc@@ tion of bot@@ h bi@@ olog@@ ical and cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity on the plan@@ et . Now , the problem is@@ n &apos;t change .
A@@ ll cul@@ tu@@ res through all time have con@@ stan@@ tly been en@@ ga@@ ged in a d@@ ance with new pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities of life .
And the problem is not technology it@@ self .
The S@@ i@@ ou@@ x In@@ di@@ ans did not st@@ op being S@@ i@@ ou@@ x when they ga@@ ve up the bo@@ w and ar@@ ro@@ w any more than an Amer@@ ic@@ an stop@@ p@@ ed being an Amer@@ ic@@ an when he ga@@ ve up the h@@ or@@ se and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that th@@ re@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here . It is power ,
the c@@ ru@@ de face of d@@ om@@ in@@ ation .
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you disc@@ over that these are not cul@@ tu@@ res de@@ st@@ in@@ ed to fa@@ de away ;
these are d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic li@@ ving pe@@ op@@ les being dri@@ ven out of ex@@ ist@@ ence by i@@ den@@ ti@@ fi@@ able for@@ ces that are be@@ y@@ ond their cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to :
w@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the h@@ om@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an -- a people who li@@ ved f@@ ree in the for@@ est un@@ ti@@ l a gener@@ ation ago , and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to serv@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ st@@ itu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s , where you can see the ri@@ ver it@@ self is s@@ o@@ i@@ led with the s@@ il@@ t that se@@ em@@ s to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the S@@ ou@@ th Chin@@ a S@@ e@@ a , where the J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ se f@@ re@@ i@@ gh@@ ters han@@ g light in the h@@ or@@ iz@@ on
ready to f@@ ill their h@@ ol@@ ds with ra@@ w log@@ s ri@@ pp@@ ed from the for@@ est --
or , in the ca@@ se of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i , it &apos;s the di@@ se@@ ase en@@ tit@@ ies that have come in , in the wa@@ ke of the disc@@ o@@ very of g@@ old .
O@@ r if we go into the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of T@@ i@@ b@@ et , where I &apos;m doing a lot of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch rec@@ en@@ tly , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a c@@ ru@@ de face of polit@@ ical d@@ om@@ in@@ ation .
You know , gen@@ oc@@ ide , the ph@@ ys@@ ical ex@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion of a people is uni@@ vers@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ned , but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the de@@ struc@@ tion of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ned , it &apos;s uni@@ vers@@ ally , in many qu@@ ar@@ ters , cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated as part of a develop@@ ment str@@ at@@ eg@@ y .
And you c@@ an@@ not understand the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ b@@ et un@@ ti@@ l you mo@@ ve through it at the gr@@ ound lev@@ el .
I on@@ ce tra@@ vel@@ led 6@@ ,000 mi@@ les from Ch@@ en@@ g@@ d@@ u in W@@ est@@ er@@ n Chin@@ a over@@ land through s@@ ou@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n T@@ i@@ b@@ et to L@@ ha@@ s@@ a
with a y@@ oun@@ g col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e , and it was only when I got to L@@ ha@@ s@@ a that I under@@ st@@ ood the face be@@ h@@ ind the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ics you he@@ ar about :
6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ments t@@ or@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and as@@ he@@ s , 1@@ .@@ 2 million people kil@@ led by the c@@ ad@@ res d@@ ur@@ ing the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ evolu@@ tion .
This y@@ oun@@ g man &apos;s fa@@ ther had been as@@ c@@ ri@@ be@@ d to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ am@@ a .
That me@@ ant he was in@@ stan@@ tly kil@@ led at the time of the Chin@@ e@@ se in@@ va@@ sion .
H@@ is un@@ c@@ le f@@ led with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ in@@ ess in the D@@ i@@ a@@ sp@@ or@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al .
H@@ is mo@@ ther was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the c@@ ri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y .
He was s@@ mu@@ g@@ g@@ led into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ at@@ h her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she cou@@ ldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be with@@ out him .
The si@@ ster who had done that bra@@ ve deed was put into an e@@ duc@@ ation cam@@ p .
One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ mb@@ and of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gre@@ s@@ sion , she was gi@@ ven se@@ ven years of hard la@@ b@@ or .
The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ b@@ et can be im@@ pos@@ sible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive sp@@ ir@@ it of the people is something to be@@ h@@ old .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a ch@@ o@@ ice :
do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ ati@@ c world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ ati@@ c world of di@@ vers@@ ity ?
M@@ ar@@ g@@ ar@@ et M@@ e@@ ad , the great an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ st , said , before she di@@ ed , that her gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted to@@ war@@ ds this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ p@@ hou@@ s gener@@ ic world vie@@ w
not only would we see the enti@@ re ran@@ ge of the human ima@@ gin@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w mo@@ d@@ al@@ ity of thought , but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day ha@@ ving for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten there were even other pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities .
And it &apos;s hu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing to re@@ me@@ mber that our spec@@ ies has , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , been around for &#91; 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolu@@ tion -- which ga@@ ve us a@@ gr@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , at which time we suc@@ cu@@ m@@ be@@ d to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the p@@ oe@@ try of the s@@ ha@@ man was di@@ sp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pr@@ ie@@ s@@ th@@ ood ; we cre@@ ated hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 1@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago .
The mo@@ der@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al world as we know it is b@@ ar@@ ely 3@@ 00 years old .
Now , that sh@@ al@@ low hi@@ story doesn &apos;t su@@ g@@ ge@@ st to me that we have all the ans@@ wer@@ s for all of the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges that will conf@@ ron@@ t us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ l@@ en@@ ni@@ a .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tu@@ res of the world are as@@ ked the me@@ an@@ ing of being human , they resp@@ ond with 1@@ 0@@ ,000 different vo@@ ic@@ es .
And it &apos;s with@@ in that s@@ ong that we will all re@@ disc@@ over the pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ity of being what we are : a f@@ ul@@ ly con@@ sci@@ ous spec@@ ies , f@@ ul@@ ly a@@ w@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all g@@ ar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh . And there are great mom@@ ents of op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
This is a ph@@ oto@@ grap@@ h I took at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ a@@ ff@@ in I@@ s@@ land when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some In@@ uit people ,
and this man , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k , t@@ old me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment has not always been kind to the In@@ uit people , and d@@ ur@@ ing the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s , to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh our s@@ over@@ ei@@ g@@ n@@ ty , we for@@ c@@ ed them into se@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ ments .
This old man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther re@@ f@@ used to go .
The fam@@ ily , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his we@@ ap@@ ons , all of his t@@ oo@@ ls .
Now , you m@@ ust understand that the In@@ uit did not fe@@ ar the c@@ old ; they took ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ge of it .
The r@@ un@@ n@@ ers of their sle@@ ds were or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally made of f@@ ish wr@@ app@@ ed in c@@ ari@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de .
So , this man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther was not in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated by the A@@ r@@ c@@ tic ni@@ ght or the b@@ li@@ z@@ z@@ ard that was b@@ lo@@ wing .
He simp@@ ly sli@@ pp@@ ed out@@ side , p@@ ul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . And as the f@@ ec@@ es beg@@ an to f@@ ree@@ ze , he sh@@ ap@@ ed it into the form of a bla@@ de .
He put a sp@@ ra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe
and as it fin@@ ally fro@@ ze s@@ o@@ li@@ d , he bu@@ t@@ ch@@ er@@ ed a do@@ g with it .
He s@@ kin@@ ned the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ne@@ ss ,
took the ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge of the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a sle@@ d ,
har@@ ne@@ ss@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g , and di@@ s@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed over the ice f@@ lo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in bel@@ t .
Talk about getting by with no@@ thing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the re@@ si@@ li@@ ence of the In@@ uit people and of all in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment in A@@ pri@@ l of 19@@ 9@@ 9 ga@@ ve back to tot@@ al contro@@ l of the In@@ uit an are@@ a of land lar@@ ger than C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put together . It &apos;s our new h@@ om@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an in@@ de@@ pen@@ dent ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y . They contro@@ l all min@@ er@@ al res@@ our@@ ces .
A@@ n a@@ ma@@ zing example of how a n@@ ation@@ -@@ st@@ ate can se@@ ek re@@ st@@ itu@@ tion with its people .
And fin@@ ally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pret@@ ty ob@@ vi@@ ous at lea@@ st to all of all us who &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed in these re@@ mot@@ e re@@ ach@@ es of the plan@@ et , to re@@ ali@@ ze that they &apos;re not re@@ mot@@ e at all .
They &apos;re h@@ om@@ el@@ and@@ s of some@@ body .
They re@@ pres@@ ent br@@ an@@ ch@@ es of the human ima@@ gin@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of time . And for all of us , the dre@@ am@@ s of these children , like the dre@@ am@@ s of our own children , be@@ come part of the na@@ ked ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y of hop@@ e .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the N@@ ational Ge@@ o@@ grap@@ hi@@ c , fin@@ ally , is , we believe that polit@@ ici@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh any@@ thing .
We think that po@@ le@@ m@@ ics -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ m@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ a@@ si@@ ve , but we think that stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ling inst@@ itu@@ tion in the world . We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our we@@ b@@ s@@ ite every m@@ ont@@ h . 1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our tel@@ e@@ vi@@ sion chan@@ ne@@ l . O@@ ur ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es are re@@ ad by mil@@ li@@ ons .
And what we &apos;re doing is a ser@@ ies of j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys to the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here where we &apos;re going to take our au@@ di@@ ence to pl@@ ac@@ es of s@@ uch cul@@ tur@@ al w@@ onder that they c@@ an@@ not help but come away da@@ z@@ z@@ led by what they have s@@ een , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , ther@@ ef@@ ore , em@@ br@@ ace gra@@ du@@ ally , one by one , the cen@@ tr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ y : that this world de@@ ser@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ ver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a tru@@ ly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tur@@ al , pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic world
where all of the wis@@ d@@ om of all pe@@ op@@ les can cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ te to our col@@ lec@@ tive wel@@ l@@ -@@ being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this b@@ ook of m@@ ine
that I hop@@ e will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve al@@ ready he@@ ard ,
and I &apos;ll try to make some con@@ nec@@ tions my@@ self , in ca@@ se you mis@@ s@@ ed them .
But I want to start with what I call the &quot; off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
The off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma of what ? The off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma of all W@@ est@@ er@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al soc@@ ie@@ ties .
And the off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma r@@ un@@ s like this : if we are interest@@ ed in ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ ing the wel@@ f@@ are of our c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze indivi@@ du@@ al f@@ ree@@ d@@ om .
The reas@@ on for this is bot@@ h that f@@ ree@@ d@@ om is in and of it@@ self good , val@@ u@@ able , wor@@ th@@ wh@@ ile , es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al to being human .
And because if people have f@@ ree@@ d@@ om , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to de@@ ci@@ de on our be@@ half .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze f@@ ree@@ d@@ om is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze ch@@ o@@ ice .
The more ch@@ o@@ ice people have , the more f@@ ree@@ d@@ om they have ,
and the more f@@ ree@@ d@@ om they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded in the water su@@ pp@@ ly that it w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t oc@@ c@@ ur to any@@ one to question it .
And it &apos;s also de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ bed@@ ded in our li@@ ves .
I &apos;ll give you some exam@@ p@@ les of what mo@@ der@@ n pro@@ gre@@ ss has made pos@@ sible for us .
This is my su@@ per@@ mar@@ ket .
No@@ t s@@ uch a big one . I want to say just a wor@@ d about s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing .
1@@ 7@@ 5 s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings in my su@@ per@@ mar@@ ket , if you don &apos;t coun@@ t the 10 ex@@ tra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ il@@ s and 1@@ 2 b@@ al@@ sa@@ mi@@ c vin@@ eg@@ ars you could bu@@ y
to make a very lar@@ ge number of your own s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chan@@ ce that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the stor@@ e has on off@@ er su@@ it you .
So this is what the su@@ per@@ mar@@ ket is like .
And then you go to the con@@ su@@ m@@ er elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- sp@@ ea@@ kers , C@@ D pla@@ y@@ er , t@@ ap@@ e pla@@ y@@ er , t@@ un@@ er , am@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ier --
and in this one s@@ ing@@ le con@@ su@@ m@@ er elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o syste@@ ms .
We can con@@ struc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ -@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o syste@@ ms out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one stor@@ e .
You &apos;ve got to ad@@ m@@ it that &apos;s a lot of ch@@ o@@ ice .
In other d@@ om@@ a@@ ins -- the world of commun@@ ic@@ ations .
There was a time , when I was a bo@@ y , when you could get any kind of tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one serv@@ ice you wanted , as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell .
You ren@@ ted your ph@@ one . You didn &apos;t bu@@ y it .
One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the ph@@ one never bro@@ ke .
And those da@@ ys are g@@ one .
We now have an al@@ most un@@ lim@@ ited v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ty of ph@@ ones ,
e@@ speci@@ ally in the world of c@@ ell ph@@ ones .
These are c@@ ell ph@@ ones of the fu@@ ture .
My fa@@ vor@@ ite is the mid@@ d@@ le one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 pla@@ y@@ er , n@@ ose ha@@ ir tri@@ mm@@ er , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e t@@ or@@ ch .
And if by some chan@@ ce you ha@@ ven &apos;t s@@ een that in your stor@@ e y@@ et , you can re@@ st as@@ su@@ red that one day s@@ oon , you will .
And what this does is it lea@@ ds people to w@@ alk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this question .
And do you know what the ans@@ wer to this question now is ?
The ans@@ wer is &quot; no . &quot;
It is not pos@@ sible to bu@@ y a c@@ ell ph@@ one that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other a@@ spec@@ ts of life that are much more sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same ex@@ pl@@ os@@ ion of ch@@ o@@ ice is tru@@ e .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th c@@ are . It is no l@@ on@@ ger the ca@@ se in the U@@ n@@ ited St@@ ates that you go to the do@@ c@@ tor , and the do@@ c@@ tor tel@@ ls you what to do .
In@@ ste@@ ad , you go to the do@@ c@@ tor , and the do@@ c@@ tor tel@@ ls you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B@@ .
A has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks .
B has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; D@@ o@@ c , what should I do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; A has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks , and B has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were me , D@@ o@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And the resul@@ t is -- we call it &quot; p@@ ati@@ ent au@@ t@@ onom@@ y , &quot;
which ma@@ kes it s@@ ound like a good thing , but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the resp@@ on@@ si@@ bil@@ ity for de@@ ci@@ sion@@ -@@ making from some@@ body who kno@@ ws something -- nam@@ ely , the do@@ c@@ tor -- to some@@ body who kno@@ ws no@@ thing and is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly s@@ ick and th@@ us not in the best sh@@ ap@@ e to be making de@@ ci@@ si@@ ons -- nam@@ ely , the p@@ ati@@ ent . There &apos;s enor@@ m@@ ous mar@@ ke@@ ting of pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion dru@@ gs
to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , ma@@ kes no sense at all , sin@@ ce we can &apos;t bu@@ y them .
Wh@@ y do they mar@@ ket to us if we can &apos;t bu@@ y them ?
The ans@@ wer is that they exp@@ ect us to call our do@@ c@@ t@@ ors the next mor@@ ning and as@@ k for our pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tions to be chan@@ ged .
S@@ ome@@ thing as dra@@ m@@ ati@@ c as our i@@ den@@ t@@ ity has now be@@ come a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ice , as this sli@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate .
We don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an i@@ den@@ t@@ ity ; we get to in@@ v@@ ent it .
And we get to re@@ -@@ in@@ v@@ ent our@@ selves as of@@ ten as we like .
And that me@@ ans that every day , when you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning , you have to de@@ ci@@ de what kind of person you want to be .
W@@ it@@ h resp@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and fam@@ ily ,
there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that al@@ most every@@ one had is that you got mar@@ r@@ ied as s@@ oon as you could , and then you started ha@@ ving kids as s@@ oon as you could .
The only real ch@@ o@@ ice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
No@@ wa@@ da@@ ys , everything is very much up for gra@@ b@@ s .
I te@@ ach wonder@@ f@@ ul@@ ly intel@@ li@@ gen@@ t stu@@ den@@ ts , and I as@@ sig@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less s@@ mar@@ t , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ gen@@ t .
It &apos;s because they are pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ p@@ ied , as@@ king the@@ m@@ selves ,
&quot; S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ r@@ ied or not ? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ r@@ ied now ? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ r@@ ied later ?
S@@ h@@ ould I have kids first , or a car@@ e@@ er first ? &quot;
A@@ ll of these are con@@ su@@ ming quest@@ i@@ ons .
And they &apos;re going to ans@@ wer these quest@@ i@@ ons , w@@ he@@ ther or not it me@@ ans not doing all the work I as@@ sig@@ n and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ ses .
And in@@ deed they should . These are important quest@@ i@@ ons to ans@@ wer .
W@@ or@@ k -- we are b@@ le@@ ss@@ ed , as C@@ ar@@ l was po@@ in@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every minu@@ te of every day from any place on the plan@@ et -- ex@@ cep@@ t the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el .
There is one cor@@ ner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell any@@ body about , where the W@@ i@@ F@@ i actually wor@@ ks .
I &apos;m not tel@@ ling you about it because I want to use it .
So what this me@@ ans , this incre@@ di@@ ble f@@ ree@@ d@@ om of ch@@ o@@ ice we have with resp@@ ect to work , is that we have to make a de@@ ci@@ sion , again and again and again , about w@@ he@@ ther we should or sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be working .
We can go to wat@@ ch our k@@ id pla@@ y soc@@ c@@ er , and we have our c@@ ell ph@@ one on one hi@@ p , and our B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our l@@ ap@@ top , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ b@@ ly , on our l@@ ap@@ s .
And even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every minu@@ te that we &apos;re wat@@ ch@@ ing our k@@ id mu@@ t@@ il@@ ate a soc@@ c@@ er ga@@ me , we are also as@@ king our@@ selves , &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I ans@@ wer this c@@ ell ph@@ one call ?
S@@ h@@ ould I resp@@ ond to this e@@ ma@@ il ? S@@ h@@ ould I dra@@ ft this let@@ ter ? &quot;
And even if the ans@@ wer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly going to make the experi@@ ence of your k@@ id &apos;s soc@@ c@@ er ga@@ me very different than it would &apos;ve been .
So every@@ where we look , big things and sm@@ all things , mater@@ ial things and li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le things , life is a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ice .
And the world we used to live in loo@@ ked like this .
&#91; Well , actually , they are wr@@ itten in st@@ one . &#93; That is to say , there were some ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es , but not everything was a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ice .
And the world we now live in loo@@ ks like this . &#91; The T@@ en C@@ om@@ m@@ and@@ ments D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it &#93;
And the question is , is this good ne@@ ws , or b@@ ad ne@@ ws ?
And the ans@@ wer is , &quot; y@@ es . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s b@@ ad about it .
A@@ ll of this ch@@ o@@ ice has two eff@@ ec@@ ts , two ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ec@@ ts on people .
One eff@@ ect , par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ically , is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , ra@@ ther than li@@ ber@@ ation .
W@@ it@@ h so many op@@ tions to ch@@ o@@ ose from , people find it very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to ch@@ o@@ ose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ m@@ ati@@ c example of this : a stu@@ dy that was done of in@@ ve@@ st@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment plan@@ s .
A col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e of m@@ ine got ac@@ c@@ ess to in@@ ve@@ st@@ ment rec@@ or@@ ds from V@@ an@@ gu@@ ard , the gi@@ gan@@ tic mu@@ tu@@ al@@ -@@ fu@@ nd comp@@ any of about a million em@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ pl@@ ac@@ es .
And what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tu@@ al fun@@ ds the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er off@@ er@@ ed , r@@ ate of parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation went down two percent .
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ wer em@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ es parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er five . Wh@@ y ?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to ch@@ o@@ ose from , it &apos;s so da@@ m@@ n hard to de@@ ci@@ de which fu@@ nd to ch@@ o@@ ose , that you &apos;ll just put it off un@@ ti@@ l t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w . And then t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w ,
and of course t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w never comes .
U@@ n@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also me@@ ans that making the de@@ ci@@ sion is so hard that they pas@@ s up sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mat@@ ch@@ ing money from the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er .
B@@ y not parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating , they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollars a year
from the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er , who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion .
So par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of ha@@ ving too many ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es . And I think it ma@@ kes the world look like this .
&#91; And la@@ st@@ ly , for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , F@@ ren@@ ch , b@@ le@@ u ch@@ e@@ e@@ se , or ran@@ ch ? &#93;
You really want to get the de@@ ci@@ sion right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pic@@ k the wr@@ ong mu@@ tu@@ al fu@@ nd , or the wr@@ ong s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing .
So that &apos;s one eff@@ ect . The second eff@@ ect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and make a ch@@ o@@ ice , we end up less s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied with the resul@@ t of the ch@@ o@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to ch@@ o@@ ose from .
And there are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons for this .
One of them is that with a lot of different s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings to ch@@ o@@ ose from , if you bu@@ y one , and it &apos;s not per@@ f@@ ect -- and what s@@ al@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing is ? --
it &apos;s e@@ as@@ y to ima@@ g@@ ine you could have made a different ch@@ o@@ ice that would have been better .
And what happ@@ ens is this ima@@ gin@@ ed al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gr@@ et the de@@ ci@@ sion you made ,
and this re@@ gr@@ et sub@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the de@@ ci@@ sion you made , even if it was a good de@@ ci@@ sion .
The more op@@ tions there are , the ea@@ si@@ er it is to re@@ gr@@ et any@@ thing at all that is di@@ s@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ ose .
S@@ ec@@ ond , what econom@@ ist@@ s call &quot; op@@ port@@ un@@ ity co@@ sts . &quot;
Dan G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this mor@@ ning of tal@@ king about how much the way in which we val@@ ue things de@@ pen@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to .
Well , when there are l@@ ots of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves to con@@ si@@ der , it is e@@ as@@ y to ima@@ g@@ ine the at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ve fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ ject
that make you less s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied with the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative that you &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en .
Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t st@@ op thinking about those other a@@ va@@ il@@ able par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et &#93; S@@ or@@ ry if you &apos;re not New Yor@@ kers .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to be thinking .
Here &apos;s this cou@@ ple on the H@@ am@@ p@@ t@@ ons .
Ver@@ y exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve real est@@ ate .
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach . B@@ e@@ au@@ ti@@ ful day . They have it all to the@@ m@@ selves .
What could be better ? &quot; Well , da@@ m@@ n it , &quot; this gu@@ y is thinking ,
&quot; It &apos;s A@@ u@@ g@@ ust . E@@ very@@ body in my M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood is away .
I could be par@@ king right in f@@ ron@@ t of my building . &quot;
And he sp@@ en@@ ds two we@@ e@@ ks na@@ g@@ ged by the idea that he is mis@@ sing the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
O@@ p@@ port@@ un@@ ity co@@ sts sub@@ tr@@ act from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we ch@@ o@@ ose , even when what we ch@@ o@@ ose is ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ic .
And the more op@@ tions there are to con@@ si@@ der , the more at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ve fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of these op@@ tions
are going to be re@@ f@@ lec@@ ted by us as op@@ port@@ un@@ ity co@@ sts .
Here &apos;s another example .
Now this car@@ t@@ oon ma@@ kes a lot of po@@ in@@ ts .
It ma@@ kes po@@ in@@ ts about li@@ ving in the moment as well , and probably about doing things s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly .
But one point it ma@@ kes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing not to do other things
that may have l@@ ots of at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ve fe@@ at@@ u@@ res , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ve .
Th@@ ir@@ d : e@@ sc@@ al@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans .
I we@@ ar j@@ e@@ ans al@@ most all the time .
There was a time when j@@ e@@ ans came in one f@@ la@@ v@@ or , and you b@@ ou@@ ght them , and they f@@ it like c@@ ra@@ p , they were incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly un@@ com@@ for@@ t@@ able , if you wor@@ e them and wa@@ s@@ he@@ d them enough times , they started to feel OK .
I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans after years of we@@ aring these old ones ,
and I said , &quot; I want a pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ ans . Here &apos;s my si@@ ze . &quot;
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said , &quot; D@@ o you want sli@@ m f@@ it , e@@ as@@ y f@@ it , rel@@ a@@ x@@ ed f@@ it ?
You want bu@@ t@@ ton f@@ ly or zi@@ p@@ per f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ wa@@ s@@ he@@ d or ac@@ id@@ -@@ wa@@ s@@ he@@ d ?
D@@ o you want them di@@ stre@@ ss@@ ed ?
You want boo@@ t c@@ ut , t@@ ap@@ er@@ ed , bla@@ h bla@@ h . &quot; O@@ n and on he went .
My j@@ a@@ w d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed . And after I rec@@ over@@ ed , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
He had no idea what that was , so I sp@@ ent an h@@ our trying on all these da@@ m@@ n j@@ e@@ ans ,
and I wal@@ ked out of the stor@@ e -- tru@@ th ! -- with the be@@ st@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting j@@ e@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . A@@ ll this ch@@ o@@ ice made it pos@@ sible for me to do better .
But -- I f@@ elt wor@@ se .
Wh@@ y ? I wr@@ ot@@ e a whole b@@ ook to try to ex@@ pla@@ in this to my@@ self .
The reas@@ on -- The reas@@ on I f@@ elt wor@@ se is that , with all of these op@@ tions a@@ va@@ il@@ able , my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about how good a pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low , no parti@@ cu@@ lar exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one f@@ la@@ v@@ or .
When they came in 100 f@@ la@@ vor@@ s , da@@ m@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been per@@ f@@ ect .
And what I got was good , but it wa@@ sn &apos;t per@@ f@@ ect .
And so I comp@@ ar@@ ed what I got to what I exp@@ ec@@ ted , and what I got was di@@ s@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting in comp@@ ar@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ec@@ ted .
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s li@@ ves can &apos;t help but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
And what that &apos;s going to produc@@ e is less s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion with resul@@ ts , even when they &apos;re good resul@@ ts .
No@@ body in the world of mar@@ ke@@ ting kno@@ ws this .
&#91; It all loo@@ ks so great . I can &apos;t wa@@ it to be di@@ s@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted . &#93; Because if they did , you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
The tru@@ th is more like this .
&#91; E@@ very@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se &#93;
The reas@@ on that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se , it was actually pos@@ sible for people to have experi@@ en@@ ces that were a ple@@ as@@ ant sur@@ pri@@ se .
No@@ wa@@ da@@ ys , the world we live in -- we a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent , indu@@ stri@@ al@@ ized c@@ it@@ iz@@ ens , with per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation -- the best you can ever hop@@ e for is that stuff is as good as you exp@@ ect it to be .
You will never be ple@@ as@@ an@@ tly sur@@ pri@@ s@@ ed because your exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations , my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations ,
have g@@ one through the r@@ oo@@ f . The sec@@ r@@ et to happ@@ in@@ ess -- this is what you all came for -- the sec@@ r@@ et to happ@@ in@@ ess is low exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
&#91; You &apos;ll do &#93; I want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bi@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical moment -- that I actually am mar@@ r@@ ied to a wi@@ fe , and she &apos;s really quite wonder@@ ful .
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t have done better .
I didn &apos;t se@@ t@@ tle .
But se@@ t@@ t@@ ling is@@ n &apos;t always s@@ uch a b@@ ad thing . F@@ in@@ ally -- One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ ans when there is only one kind to bu@@ y is that when you are di@@ ss@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied , and you as@@ k why ,
who &apos;s resp@@ on@@ sible ,
the ans@@ wer is c@@ le@@ ar : the world is resp@@ on@@ sible . What could you do ?
When there are h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of j@@ e@@ ans a@@ va@@ il@@ able , and you bu@@ y one that is di@@ s@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting , and you as@@ k why , who &apos;s resp@@ on@@ sible ?
It is e@@ qu@@ ally c@@ le@@ ar that the ans@@ wer to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
You could have done better .
W@@ it@@ h a h@@ un@@ d@@ red different kin@@ ds of j@@ e@@ ans on di@@ sp@@ la@@ y , there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for fa@@ il@@ ure .
And so when people make de@@ ci@@ si@@ ons , and even thou@@ gh the resul@@ ts of the de@@ ci@@ si@@ ons are good , they feel di@@ s@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted about them ;
they bla@@ me the@@ m@@ selves .
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has exp@@ lo@@ ded in the indu@@ stri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation .
I believe a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant -- not the only , but a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant -- cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tor to this ex@@ pl@@ os@@ ion of de@@ pres@@ sion , and also su@@ ici@@ de , is that people have experi@@ en@@ ces that are di@@ s@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting because their stand@@ ar@@ ds are so hi@@ gh ,
and then when they have to ex@@ pla@@ in these experi@@ en@@ ces to the@@ m@@ selves , they think they &apos;re at fa@@ ul@@ t .
And so the net resul@@ t is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y , and we feel wor@@ se .
So let me re@@ m@@ ind you .
This is the off@@ ic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be tru@@ e , and it &apos;s all f@@ al@@ se .
It is not tru@@ e .
There &apos;s no question that some ch@@ o@@ ice is better than n@@ one , but it doesn &apos;t f@@ ol@@ low from that that more ch@@ o@@ ice is better than some ch@@ o@@ ice .
There &apos;s some ma@@ g@@ ical am@@ oun@@ t . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pret@@ ty con@@ fi@@ dent that we have long sin@@ ce pas@@ s@@ ed the point where op@@ tions im@@ pro@@ ve our wel@@ f@@ are .
Now , as a po@@ lic@@ y mat@@ ter -- I &apos;m al@@ most done -- as a po@@ lic@@ y mat@@ ter , the thing to think about is this :
what en@@ ab@@ les all of this ch@@ o@@ ice in indu@@ stri@@ al soc@@ ie@@ ties is mater@@ ial a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ence .
There are l@@ ots of pl@@ ac@@ es in the world , and we have he@@ ard about se@@ ver@@ al of them , where their problem is not that they have too much ch@@ o@@ ice . The@@ ir problem is that they have too little .
So the stuff I &apos;m tal@@ king about is the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of mo@@ der@@ n , a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent , W@@ est@@ er@@ n soc@@ ie@@ ties .
And what is so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and inf@@ ur@@ i@@ ating is this : S@@ te@@ ve L@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ t tal@@ ked to you ye@@ ster@@ day about how these exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve and diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ inst@@ all chil@@ d se@@ at@@ s don &apos;t help . It &apos;s a wa@@ ste of money .
What I &apos;m tel@@ ling you is that these exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve , comp@@ lic@@ ated ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es -- it &apos;s not simp@@ ly that they don &apos;t help . They actually h@@ ur@@ t .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our soc@@ ie@@ ties to make all of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to soc@@ ie@@ ties in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s li@@ ves be im@@ pro@@ ved ,
but our@@ s would be im@@ pro@@ ved also ,
which is what econom@@ ist@@ s call a &quot; P@@ are@@ to@@ -@@ im@@ pro@@ ving mo@@ ve . &quot;
In@@ come re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion will make every@@ one better off -- not just p@@ oor people -- because of how all this ex@@ c@@ ess ch@@ o@@ ice pla@@ gu@@ es us .
So to con@@ clu@@ de . &#91; You can be any@@ thing you want to be -- no lim@@ its &#93; You &apos;re su@@ p@@ pos@@ ed to re@@ ad this car@@ t@@ oon , and , being a s@@ op@@ hi@@ st@@ ic@@ ated person , say , &quot; A@@ h ! What does this f@@ ish know ?
You know , no@@ thing is pos@@ sible in this f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l . &quot;
I@@ mp@@ over@@ is@@ he@@ d ima@@ gin@@ ation , a my@@ op@@ ic vie@@ w of the world -- and that &apos;s the way I re@@ ad it at first .
The more I thought about it , ho@@ we@@ ver , the more I came to the vie@@ w that this f@@ ish kno@@ ws something .
Because the tru@@ th of the mat@@ ter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is pos@@ sible , you don &apos;t have f@@ ree@@ d@@ om . You have par@@ al@@ ys@@ is .
If you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is pos@@ sible , you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
E@@ very@@ body ne@@ eds a f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
This one is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly too lim@@ ited -- per@@ h@@ ap@@ s even for the f@@ ish , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly for us .
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some me@@ t@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for mis@@ er@@ y , and , I su@@ sp@@ ect , di@@ sa@@ ster .
Thank you very much .
