Se@@ ver@@ al years ago here at TED , Pe@@ ter S@@ k@@ ill@@ man introduc@@ ed a design challen@@ ge
called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challen@@ ge .
And the idea &apos;s pretty simple : Te@@ ams of four have to build the tal@@ le@@ st f@@ ree@@ -@@ standing structure out of 20 st@@ ic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ het@@ t@@ i , one y@@ ard of t@@ ape , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
And , though it seem@@ s really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it for@@ ces people to col@@ labor@@ ate very quickly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op .
And it was a huge succ@@ ess .
And since then , I &apos;ve con@@ duc@@ ted about 70 design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ s across the world with students and desig@@ ners and architec@@ ts , even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ or@@ tun@@ e 50 ,
and there &apos;s something about this ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se that re@@ ve@@ als very de@@ ep le@@ ss@@ ons about the nature of col@@ labor@@ ation , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
So , norm@@ ally , most people begin by or@@ i@@ en@@ ting themselves to the t@@ ask .
They talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they j@@ oc@@ key for power .
Then they spend some time plan@@ ning , organ@@ iz@@ ing ,
they s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ ag@@ het@@ t@@ i .
They spend the maj@@ or@@ ity of their time as@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ing the st@@ ic@@ ks into e@@ ver@@ -@@ growing struc@@ tures .
And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! --
they ad@@ m@@ ire their work .
But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h , &quot; because the we@@ ight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low cau@@ ses the entire structure to b@@ uc@@ k@@ le and to col@@ lap@@ se .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h &quot; mom@@ ents than others ,
and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ ates of business school .
They lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produc@@ e really la@@ me struc@@ tures .
And of course there are te@@ ams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; struc@@ tures ,
and am@@ ong the best are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
As Pe@@ ter tel@@ ls us , not only do they produc@@ e the tal@@ le@@ st struc@@ tures , but they &apos;re the most interesting struc@@ tures of them all .
So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Why ? What is it about them ?
And Pe@@ ter li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the kids spend any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pa@@ g@@ het@@ t@@ i , In@@ c . Right ?
They don &apos;t spend time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for power .
But there &apos;s another reason as well .
And the reason is that business students are tra@@ ined to find the single right plan , right ?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te on it .
And then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
S@@ ound fam@@ ili@@ ar ? Right .
What kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ently
is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ,
and they build prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , succ@@ es@@ sive prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es ,
always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have mul@@ ti@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they build prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es along the way .
De@@ sig@@ ners recogni@@ ze this type of col@@ labor@@ ation as the essen@@ ce of the it@@ er@@ ative process .
And with each ver@@ sion , kids get inst@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to play in prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e is really essenti@@ al ,
but let &apos;s look at how different te@@ ams per@@ form .
So the aver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ;
business sch@@ ools students , about half of that ; la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , a little better , but not much better than that ,
kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most ad@@ ul@@ ts .
Wh@@ o does the very best ?
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts and engin@@ e@@ ers , th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly .
Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y-@@ n@@ ine in@@ ches is the tal@@ le@@ st structure I &apos;ve seen .
And why is it ? Because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ing ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical patter@@ ns are the key to building st@@ able struc@@ tures .
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s , a little bit better than aver@@ age ,
but here &apos;s where it gets interesting . If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly better .
It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
You can just tell befor@@ e@@ hand . And why is that ?
Because they have spec@@ ial sk@@ il@@ ls of fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation .
They man@@ age the process , they understand the process .
And any team who man@@ a@@ ges and pa@@ ys close atten@@ tion to work will sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ an@@ tly im@@ pro@@ ve the team &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
Sp@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ ized sk@@ il@@ ls and fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation sk@@ il@@ ls are the combin@@ ation that lea@@ ds to str@@ ong succ@@ ess .
If you have 10 te@@ ams that typ@@ ically per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing struc@@ tures .
And I tried something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
So I off@@ er@@ ed a 10@@ ,000 dollar pri@@ ze of software to the win@@ ning team .
So what do you think happened to these design students ?
What was the resul@@ t ?
Here &apos;s what happened :
Not one team had a standing structure .
If any@@ one had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the pri@@ ze .
So , isn &apos;t that interesting ? That high sta@@ kes have a str@@ ong impact .
We did the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se again with the same students .
What do you think happened then ?
So now they understand the value of prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ing .
So the same team went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very best .
They produc@@ ed the tal@@ le@@ st struc@@ tures in the least amount of time .
So there &apos;s de@@ ep le@@ ss@@ ons for us about the nature of in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves and succ@@ ess .
So , you might ask : Why would any@@ one actually spend time wr@@ iting a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challen@@ ge ?
And the reason is , I help create dig@@ ital tools and proc@@ ess@@ es to help te@@ ams build c@@ ars and video g@@ ames and visu@@ al effec@@ ts .
And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challen@@ ge does is it hel@@ ps them iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y the hi@@ dden as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions .
Because , f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
The challen@@ ge pro@@ vide@@ s a sh@@ ared experience , a common language , a common st@@ ance to build the right prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ Ch@@ allen@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ .
It &apos;s a b@@ log that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
There &apos;s ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
There are cra@@ z@@ y exam@@ p@@ les from around the world of how people twe@@ a@@ k and ad@@ just the system .
There &apos;s world recor@@ ds that are on this as well .
And the funda@@ mental le@@ ss@@ on , I believe , is that design tru@@ ly is a contact sp@@ ort .
It de@@ m@@ ands that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the t@@ ask , and that we app@@ ly the very best of our thinking , our fe@@ eling and our doing to the challen@@ ge that we have at hand .
And sometimes , a little prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s pret@@ end right here we have a machine . A big machine , a cool , TED@@ -@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
And everyone in this room has to get into it .
And you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot sta@@ y where you are .
And I w@@ onder what you &apos;d cho@@ ose , because I &apos;ve been as@@ king my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were autom@@ o@@ bi@@ les or T@@ wit@@ ter or &quot; American I@@ do@@ l . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m con@@ vin@@ ced that there &apos;s some sort of pul@@ l to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a , to wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that cro@@ w@@ d , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous . It &apos;s because pos@@ sibil@@ ities on this planet ,
they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
So I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
This is the gre@@ at@@ est time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any meas@@ ure that you w@@ ish to cho@@ ose : health , we@@ al@@ th , mo@@ bil@@ ity , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing r@@ ates of disease ...
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
My gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
My gr@@ and@@ parents p@@ us@@ hed that number to 70 .
My parents are clos@@ ing in on 80 .
So there better be a n@@ ine at the beginning of my death number .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us ,
because this is a bi@@ gger deal than that .
A k@@ id bor@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i today can exp@@ ect to live as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
Th@@ in@@ k about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is it true ?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x kil@@ led bil@@ lions of people on this planet .
It re@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed the demo@@ graph@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
It &apos;s gone . It &apos;s van@@ is@@ hed .
We van@@ qu@@ is@@ hed it . P@@ u@@ ff .
In the r@@ ich world , dise@@ ases that th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed mil@@ lions of us just a gener@@ ation ago no longer ex@@ ist , har@@ d@@ ly .
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia , ru@@ bel@@ la , po@@ li@@ o ...
does any@@ one even know what those things are ?
V@@ acc@@ ines , moder@@ n medic@@ ine , our ability to fe@@ ed bil@@ lions of people , those are tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s of the scienti@@ fic meth@@ od .
And to my mind , the scienti@@ fic meth@@ od -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , chan@@ ging it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments of human@@ ity .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Un@@ fortun@@ ately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been men@@ tion@@ ed many times . And one of them is that de@@ sp@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gr@@ y in this world every day .
That number &apos;s ri@@ sing , and it &apos;s ri@@ sing really r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our ima@@ gin@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tra@@ sh this g@@ lo@@ be .
P@@ ot@@ able water , ar@@ able land , ra@@ in@@ for@@ est@@ s , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away s@@ oon , and un@@ less we innov@@ ate our way out of this me@@ ss , we &apos;re going away too .
So the question is : Can we do that ? And I think we can .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will fe@@ ed bil@@ lions of people without r@@ ap@@ ing the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also de@@ stro@@ y it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it a@@ in &apos;t wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
But here &apos;s the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at night -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at night :
We &apos;ve never needed pro@@ gre@@ ss in science more than we need it right now . Ne@@ ver . And we &apos;ve also never been in a pos@@ ition to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can today .
We &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing even@@ ts in many fi@@ el@@ ds ,
and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hun@@ dre@@ ds , 3@@ 00 years , before the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we b@@ att@@ led pro@@ gre@@ ss , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now . People w@@ ra@@ p themselves in their belie@@ fs ,
and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ tly that you can &apos;t set them free . Not even the tru@@ th will set them free .
And , li@@ sten , everyone &apos;s en@@ tit@@ led to their op@@ in@@ ion ; they &apos;re even en@@ tit@@ led to their op@@ in@@ ion about pro@@ gre@@ ss . But you know what you &apos;re not en@@ tit@@ led to ?
You &apos;re not en@@ tit@@ led to your own fac@@ ts . S@@ or@@ ry , you &apos;re not .
And this took me a@@ while to figure out .
A@@ b@@ out a de@@ ca@@ de ago , I wrote a story about vacc@@ ines for The New Yor@@ ker . A little story .
And I was ama@@ zed to find op@@ pos@@ ition : op@@ pos@@ ition to what is , after all , the most effec@@ tive public health meas@@ ure in human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I mo@@ ved on .
And s@@ oon after that , I wrote a story about gene@@ tic@@ ally engin@@ eer@@ ed food .
S@@ ame thing , only bi@@ gger .
People were going cra@@ z@@ y .
So I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Fran@@ ken@@ foo@@ ds , &quot; why they thought moving molecu@@ les around in a speci@@ fic , rather than a h@@ ap@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .
But , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I mo@@ ved on . I mean , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st . We type , we fil@@ e , we go to din@@ ner . It &apos;s f@@ ine .
But these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and even@@ tually I did .
And that &apos;s because those fan@@ at@@ ics that were dri@@ ving me cra@@ z@@ y wer@@ en &apos;t actually fan@@ at@@ ics at all .
They were thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , de@@ cent people .
They were exactly like the people in this room .
And it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much .
But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be hon@@ est . We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relation@@ ship to pro@@ gre@@ ss that we used to .
We talk about it am@@ bi@@ val@@ ently .
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic terms with little quot@@ es around it :
&quot; pro@@ gre@@ ss . &quot;
Okay , there are reas@@ ons for that , and I think we know what those reas@@ ons are .
We &apos;ve lost fa@@ ith in institu@@ tions , in auth@@ or@@ ity , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have .
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will understand .
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l , B@@ hop@@ al , the Ch@@ allen@@ ger , V@@ i@@ ox@@ x , we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ ss de@@ struc@@ tion , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
You know , you can cho@@ ose your li@@ st .
There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right ,
so be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical .
A@@ s@@ k questions , de@@ mand pr@@ oo@@ f , de@@ mand evi@@ dence . D@@ on &apos;t take anything for gr@@ an@@ ted .
But here &apos;s the thing : When you get pr@@ oo@@ f , you need to ac@@ cept the pr@@ oo@@ f , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
And the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an ep@@ ide@@ mic of fe@@ ar like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
A@@ b@@ out 12 years ago , there was a story publi@@ shed , a hor@@ ri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the ep@@ ide@@ mic of au@@ tis@@ m to the meas@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ bel@@ la vacc@@ ine sho@@ t .
Ver@@ y sc@@ ary .
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies were done to see if this was true .
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies should have been done ; it &apos;s a ser@@ ious issu@@ e .
The data came back .
The data came back from the United States , from Eng@@ land , from S@@ we@@ den , from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , and it was all the same : no cor@@ rel@@ ation , no connec@@ tion , n@@ one at all .
It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
We don &apos;t believe a b@@ unch of docu@@ ments from a government off@@ ic@@ ial gi@@ ving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
But you know what ?
The resul@@ t of that has been di@@ sa@@ str@@ ous . D@@ is@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vacc@@ ine r@@ ate for meas@@ les is going down .
That is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul , and we should be as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed of ourselves .
It &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ ble .
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
Now , I understand it . I do understand it .
Because , did any@@ one have meas@@ les here ?
H@@ as one person in this audi@@ ence ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t happen very much .
D@@ oe@@ sn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 1@@ 6@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
That &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an h@@ our .
But since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our min@@ ds , and people like J@@ en@@ ny Mc@@ Car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing mes@@ sa@@ ges of fe@@ ar and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ for@@ ms like &quot; O@@ pra@@ h &quot; and &quot; L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ ve . &quot;
And they can do it because they don &apos;t lin@@ k cau@@ s@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things se@@ em the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
And it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really s@@ oon .
This guy was a her@@ o , J@@ on@@ as S@@ alk .
He took one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
No fe@@ ar , no ag@@ on@@ y . P@@ oli@@ o -- pu@@ ff , gone .
That guy in the middle , not so much .
H@@ is name is P@@ aul O@@ ff@@ it .
He just develop@@ ed a rot@@ a@@ virus vacc@@ ine with a b@@ unch of other people .
It &apos;ll sa@@ ve the lives of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 kids in the develop@@ ing world every year .
P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , ex@@ cept that P@@ aul goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how valu@@ able they are
and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
And he actually says it that way .
So , P@@ aul &apos;s a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist .
When P@@ aul spea@@ ks in a public he@@ aring , he can &apos;t te@@ sti@@ f@@ y without ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds .
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
And why ? Because P@@ aul made a vacc@@ ine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but vacc@@ ines are essenti@@ al .
You take them away , disease comes back , hor@@ ri@@ ble dise@@ ases . And that &apos;s happening .
We have meas@@ les in this country now .
And it &apos;s getting wor@@ se , and pretty s@@ oon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a nu@@ mbers game .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
What about po@@ li@@ o ? Let &apos;s have that . Why not ?
A colle@@ ge cla@@ ss@@ mate of m@@ ine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ dent .
No one &apos;s ever said that before .
She wasn &apos;t going to vacc@@ in@@ ate her k@@ id against po@@ li@@ o ,
no way .
F@@ ine .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have po@@ li@@ o . And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have po@@ li@@ o in this country ye@@ ster@@ day .
To@@ day , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plan@@ e in La@@ go@@ s this morning , and he &apos;s fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X , right now he &apos;s over O@@ hi@@ o .
And he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to L@@ ong B@@ each , and he &apos;s going to att@@ end one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous TED din@@ ners ton@@ ight .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s inf@@ ected with a par@@ al@@ y@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
That &apos;s the planet we live on . D@@ on &apos;t pret@@ end it isn &apos;t .
Now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in l@@ ies . We love to do it .
E@@ very@@ one take their v@@ it@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Amer@@ ic@@ ans do every day .
They take the stuff , and they take al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative medic@@ ines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re u@@ sel@@ ess .
The data says it all the time .
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . They almost never do more than that .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay , you want to pa@@ y 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dar@@ k ur@@ ine ? I &apos;m tot@@ ally with you .
Dar@@ k ur@@ ine . Dar@@ k .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? Well , I think I understand , we h@@ ate B@@ ig P@@ har@@ ma .
We h@@ ate B@@ ig G@@ over@@ n@@ ment . We don &apos;t tru@@ st the Man .
And we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t : O@@ ur health care system suc@@ ks .
It &apos;s cru@@ el to mil@@ lions of people .
It &apos;s absolu@@ tely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly c@@ old and s@@ ou@@ l-@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even af@@ ford it .
So we run away from it , and where do we run ?
We lea@@ p into the ar@@ ms of B@@ ig P@@ l@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o .
That &apos;s fantast@@ ic . I love B@@ ig P@@ l@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o .
But , you know , it &apos;s really a ser@@ ious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend bil@@ lions of dollars on it .
And I have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ ps here .
N@@ one of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , fra@@ u@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fra@@ u@@ d ; ac@@ a@@ i -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding bil@@ lions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fra@@ u@@ d .
And you know what ? When I say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; What do you care ? Let people do what they want to do .
It makes them feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;re wrong .
Because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who &apos;s saying , &quot; H@@ m@@ m , I &apos;m not going to take the evi@@ dence of my ex@@ per@@ ts on ma@@ m@@ mo@@ gra@@ ms , &quot;
or some cancer qu@@ ack who wan@@ ts to tre@@ at his pati@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ene@@ ma@@ s .
When you start down the ro@@ ad where bel@@ ief and ma@@ gic re@@ place evi@@ dence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
You end up in T@@ ha@@ b@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i S@@ outh Africa .
He kil@@ led 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 of his people by in@@ si@@ sting that be@@ e@@ tr@@ oot , gar@@ li@@ c and le@@ m@@ on oil were much more effec@@ tive than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al dru@@ gs we know can s@@ low the course of AI@@ D@@ S .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of ne@@ ed@@ less de@@ a@@ ths in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this disease .
P@@ lea@@ se , don &apos;t tell me there are no con@@ sequ@@ ences to these things .
There are . There always are .
Now , the most min@@ d@@ less ep@@ ide@@ mic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d bat@@ tle between pro@@ p@@ on@@ ents of gene@@ tic@@ ally engin@@ eer@@ ed food and the organ@@ ic el@@ ite .
It &apos;s an i@@ di@@ ot@@ ic de@@ b@@ ate . It has to stop .
It &apos;s a de@@ b@@ ate about words , about met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors .
It &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
E@@ very single thing we eat , every gra@@ in of r@@ ice , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sle@@ y , every B@@ ru@@ s@@ sels spr@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ f@@ ied by man .
You know , there wer@@ en &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the gar@@ den of E@@ den .
There wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e .
There wer@@ en &apos;t Ch@@ rist@@ ma@@ s tre@@ es . We made it all .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years .
And some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
We got ri@@ d of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ ci@@ se way --
and there are ris@@ ks , absolu@@ tely --
but we can put something like v@@ it@@ am@@ in A into r@@ ice , and that stuff can help mil@@ lions of people , mil@@ lions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
We object to gene@@ tic@@ ally engin@@ eer@@ ed food .
Why do we do that ?
Well , the things I con@@ stan@@ tly hear are : To@@ o many chem@@ ic@@ als , pe@@ st@@ ic@@ ide@@ s , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture , we don &apos;t want gi@@ ant fi@@ el@@ ds of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t compan@@ ies pat@@ en@@ ting life .
We don &apos;t want compan@@ ies o@@ w@@ ning se@@ eds .
And you know what my respon@@ se to all of that is ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fi@@ x it .
It &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
This has nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s la@@ w , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
You know science isn &apos;t a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t ,
but the idea that we should not al@@ low science to do its job because we &apos;re af@@ ra@@ id , is really very de@@ a@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ ven@@ ting mil@@ lions of people from pr@@ os@@ per@@ ing .
You know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now ,
70 percent .
This inve@@ st@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years .
D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul . D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul .
They need it , and we &apos;re not gi@@ ving it to them .
And why ? G@@ ene@@ tic@@ ally engin@@ eer@@ ed food .
We don &apos;t want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge people to eat that rot@@ ten stuff , like c@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a for inst@@ ance .
C@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a &apos;s something that half a billion people eat . It &apos;s kind of like a pot@@ at@@ o .
It &apos;s just a b@@ unch of cal@@ or@@ ies . It suc@@ ks .
It doesn &apos;t have nu@@ tri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have prot@@ e@@ in , and scienti@@ sts are engin@@ eer@@ ing all of that into it right now .
And then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go bl@@ ind .
They wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
And all I can say about this is : Why are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : Why are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
Because we don &apos;t want to move gen@@ es around ?
This is about moving gen@@ es around . It &apos;s not about chem@@ ic@@ als .
It &apos;s not about our ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous pas@@ sion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our in@@ si@@ st@@ ence on having bi@@ gger food , better food , sing@@ u@@ lar food .
This isn &apos;t about R@@ ice K@@ ri@@ sp@@ ies , this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve ,
and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that me@@ ant .
Because , you know something ?
If we don &apos;t , if we contin@@ ue to act the way we &apos;re ac@@ ting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high@@ -@@ tec@@ h col@@ on@@ i@@ alis@@ m .
There &apos;s no other way to descri@@ be what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s u@@ g@@ ly , it &apos;s bene@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
So after this ama@@ z@@ ingly fun con@@ vers@@ ation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely . A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely , I do .
It &apos;s st@@ uc@@ k in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
We can set that time machine on anything we want .
We can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
We have to have these con@@ vers@@ ations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go a@@ head , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
I know that we can , and as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
One day , L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es T@@ im@@ es col@@ um@@ ni@@ st
Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was wal@@ king along
the st@@ ree@@ ts of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es
when he heard beautiful music .
And the sour@@ ce was a man ,
an Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American man ,
char@@ ming , ru@@ g@@ ged , hom@@ el@@ ess ,
pla@@ ying a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know ,
because Ste@@ ve &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns became the basis
for a book , which was turned into a mov@@ ie ,
with Ro@@ ber@@ t Do@@ w@@ ney J@@ r@@ . ac@@ ting as Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z ,
and J@@ am@@ ie F@@ ox@@ x as N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ ers ,
the Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined d@@ ou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st
wh@@ ose prom@@ is@@ ing car@@ eer was cut short
by a tra@@ gic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia .
N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel dro@@ pp@@ ed out of Ju@@ illi@@ ard , he su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed a comple@@ te brea@@ k@@ down ,
and 30 years later he was living hom@@ el@@ ess
on the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge all of you to read Ste@@ ve &apos;s book or to wat@@ ch the mov@@ ie
to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond
that form@@ ed between these two men ,
but how music hel@@ ped shape that b@@ ond ,
and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n --
in hel@@ ping N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel get off the st@@ ree@@ ts .
I met M@@ r@@ . A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8 ,
two years ago , at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all .
He had just heard a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of Be@@ eth@@ oven &apos;s F@@ ir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sy@@ mp@@ hon@@ ies ,
and came back@@ stage and introduc@@ ed hi@@ m@@ self .
He was spea@@ king in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way
about Y@@ o-@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton
and how the Do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the World S@@ er@@ ies ,
all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first viol@@ in pas@@ sa@@ ge work
in the last mo@@ vement of Be@@ eth@@ oven &apos;s F@@ our@@ th S@@ y@@ mp@@ hon@@ y .
And we got talking about music , and I got an e@@ ma@@ il from Ste@@ ve a few days later
saying that N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel was interested in a viol@@ in le@@ ss@@ on with me .
Now , I should men@@ tion that N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel ref@@ us@@ es tre@@ at@@ ment
because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ c@@ k ther@@ ap@@ y
and Th@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s ,
and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ yed with him for his entire life .
But as a resul@@ t now , he is pr@@ one to
these sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ des ,
the wor@@ st of which can mani@@ fe@@ st themselves as
him exp@@ lo@@ ding
and then dis@@ appe@@ aring for days ,
wan@@ dering the st@@ ree@@ ts of S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow ,
ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind
un@@ le@@ as@@ hed up@@ on him .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ it@@ ation
when we started our first le@@ ss@@ on at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all --
he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his eyes ,
he was lost .
And he was talking about
in@@ vi@@ sible de@@ m@@ ons and s@@ mo@@ ke ,
and how someone was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his sle@@ ep .
And I was af@@ ra@@ id ,
not for myself , but I was af@@ ra@@ id
that I was going to l@@ ose him ,
that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his st@@ ates ,
and that I would ru@@ in his relation@@ ship with the viol@@ in
if I started talking about sc@@ ales
and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exc@@ iting for@@ ms of
di@@ d@@ acti@@ c viol@@ in pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y .
So , I just started pla@@ ying .
And I pla@@ yed the first mo@@ vement of the Be@@ eth@@ oven V@@ i@@ ol@@ in Con@@ cer@@ to .
And as I pla@@ yed ,
I under@@ st@@ ood that there was a pro@@ found change
oc@@ curr@@ ing in N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel &apos;s eyes .
It was as if he was in the g@@ ri@@ p of some in@@ vi@@ sible ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical ,
a chem@@ ical re@@ action , for which my pla@@ ying the music
was its cat@@ al@@ y@@ st .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge
was transform@@ ed into understanding ,
a qu@@ iet cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity and gr@@ ace .
And in a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le , he li@@ f@@ ted his own viol@@ in
and he started pla@@ ying , by e@@ ar ,
certain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of viol@@ in con@@ cer@@ to@@ s
which he then asked me to comple@@ te -- Men@@ del@@ ss@@ o@@ h@@ n ,
T@@ cha@@ ik@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y , Si@@ bel@@ i@@ us .
And we started talking about music , from B@@ ach
to Be@@ eth@@ oven and Bra@@ h@@ ms ,
B@@ ru@@ c@@ k@@ ner , all the B &apos;s ,
from Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ Pe@@ kk@@ a S@@ al@@ on@@ en .
And I under@@ st@@ ood that he not only
had an enc@@ y@@ cl@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c knowledge of music ,
but he rel@@ ated to this music at a person@@ al level .
He sp@@ o@@ ke about it with the kind of pas@@ sion
and understanding that I share with my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es
in the L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Ph@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .
And through pla@@ ying music and talking about music ,
this man had transform@@ ed
from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dist@@ ur@@ bed man
that had just come from wal@@ king the st@@ ree@@ ts
of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es
to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te ,
br@@ illi@@ ant , Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined m@@ us@@ ici@@ an .
M@@ u@@ sic is medic@@ ine . M@@ u@@ sic changes us .
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel , music is s@@ an@@ ity .
Because music allo@@ ws him to take his thou@@ ghts
and del@@ u@@ sions and shape them
through his ima@@ gin@@ ation and his creati@@ vity ,
into real@@ ity .
And that is an esc@@ ape
from his tor@@ men@@ ted state .
And I under@@ st@@ ood that this was the very essen@@ ce of art .
This was the very reason why we made music ,
that we take something that ex@@ ists within all of us
at our very funda@@ mental cor@@ e ,
our emot@@ ions ,
and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens ,
through our creati@@ vity , we &apos;re able to shape those emot@@ ions into real@@ ity .
And the real@@ ity of that ex@@ pres@@ sion
re@@ ach@@ es all of us
and mo@@ ves us , in@@ spi@@ res and un@@ it@@ es us .
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel ,
music brought him back into a f@@ old of friends .
The re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back
into a family of m@@ us@@ ici@@ ans
that under@@ st@@ ood him ,
that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents
and re@@ spec@@ ted him .
And I will always make music with N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ iel ,
whether we &apos;re at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all
or on S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow , because he re@@ min@@ ds me
why I became a m@@ us@@ ici@@ an .
Thank you .
B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ an@@ i : Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Ro@@ ber@@ t G@@ up@@ ta .
Ro@@ ber@@ t G@@ up@@ ta : I &apos;m going to play something that I sha@@ mel@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from cel@@ li@@ sts .
So , p@@ lea@@ se for@@ give me .
I &apos;m J@@ an@@ e Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
I &apos;ve been making g@@ ames online now for 10 years ,
and my go@@ al for the next de@@ ca@@ de is to try to make it as easy to sa@@ ve the world in real life as it is to sa@@ ve the world in online g@@ ames .
Now , I have a plan for this , and it en@@ ta@@ ils con@@ vin@@ c@@ ing more people , inclu@@ ding all of you , to spend more time pla@@ ying bi@@ gger and better g@@ ames .
Right now we spend three billion hours a week pla@@ ying online g@@ ames .
Some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend pla@@ ying g@@ ames .
Ma@@ ybe too much time , consi@@ dering how many ur@@ gen@@ t problems we have to sol@@ ve in the real world . &quot;
But actually , ac@@ cor@@ ding to my research at the In@@ stitu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture , actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
Th@@ ree billion hours a week is not ne@@ arly enough game play to sol@@ ve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gen@@ t problems .
In fact , I believe that if we want to survi@@ ve the next century on this planet , we need to incre@@ ase that tot@@ al dra@@ mat@@ ically .
I &apos;ve cal@@ cul@@ ated the tot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 billion hours of game play every week .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ tu@@ itive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in :
If we want to sol@@ ve problems like hun@@ ger , p@@ over@@ ty , climate change , global conflic@@ t , o@@ bes@@ ity , I believe that we need to a@@ sp@@ ire to play g@@ ames online for at least 2@@ 1 billion hours a week , by the end of the next de@@ ca@@ de . No . I &apos;m ser@@ ious . I am .
Here &apos;s why . This picture pretty much su@@ ms up why I think g@@ ames are so essenti@@ al to the future survi@@ val of the human species . T@@ ru@@ ly .
This is a por@@ tra@@ it by photograp@@ her P@@ hi@@ l To@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
He wanted to cap@@ ture the emot@@ ion of g@@ am@@ ing ,
so he set up a camera in front of g@@ am@@ ers while they were pla@@ ying .
And this is a cla@@ s@@ sic g@@ am@@ ing emot@@ ion .
Now , if you &apos;re not a g@@ am@@ er , you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this p@@ ho@@ to .
You probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y , a little bit of fe@@ ar , but inten@@ se con@@ centr@@ ation , de@@ ep , de@@ ep focus on t@@ ack@@ ling a really difficult problem .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er , you will not@@ ice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the eyes up , and around the m@@ outh is a sig@@ n of op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m ,
and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is surpri@@ se .
This is a g@@ am@@ er who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an &quot; ep@@ ic win . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;ve heard of that .
OK , good , so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us .
A@@ n ep@@ ic win is an out@@ come that is so ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily pos@@ itive , you had no idea it was even possible until you ach@@ ie@@ ved it .
It was almost be@@ y@@ ond the th@@ re@@ sh@@ old of ima@@ gin@@ ation , and when you get there ,
you &apos;re sho@@ c@@ ked to disc@@ over what you &apos;re tru@@ ly cap@@ able of . That &apos;s an ep@@ ic win .
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win .
And this is the face that we need to see on mil@@ lions of proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next century --
the face of someone who , against all o@@ d@@ ds , is on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win .
Now , un@@ fortun@@ ately this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gen@@ t problems .
This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not G@@ ood At Li@@ fe &quot; face .
This is actually me making it . Can you see ? Yes . G@@ ood .
This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not G@@ ood At Li@@ fe &quot; face .
This is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , Californi@@ a , where I did my Ph@@ D on why we &apos;re better in g@@ ames than we are in real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers have .
We feel that we are not as good in real@@ ity as we are in g@@ ames .
I don &apos;t mean just good as in succ@@ ess@@ ful , al@@ though that &apos;s part of it .
We do ach@@ ieve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds . But I also mean good as in moti@@ v@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- in@@ spi@@ red to col@@ labor@@ ate and to coo@@ per@@ ate .
And when we &apos;re in game wor@@ l@@ ds , I believe that many of us become the best ver@@ sion of ourselves -- the most li@@ kel@@ y to help at a moment &apos;s not@@ ice ,
the most li@@ kel@@ y to st@@ ick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after fa@@ il@@ ure and try again .
And in real life , when we face fa@@ il@@ ure , when we conf@@ ron@@ t ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
We feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed ,
we feel an@@ x@@ ious , maybe de@@ press@@ ed , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated or cy@@ n@@ ical .
We never have those fe@@ el@@ ings when we &apos;re pla@@ ying g@@ ames ,
they just don &apos;t ex@@ ist in g@@ ames .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a gra@@ du@@ ate student .
What about g@@ ames makes it im@@ possible to feel that we can &apos;t ach@@ ieve everything ?
How can we take those fe@@ el@@ ings from g@@ ames and app@@ ly them to real@@ -@@ world work ?
So I looked at g@@ ames like World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft , which is really the ide@@ al col@@ labor@@ ative proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving environment .
And I started to not@@ ice a few things that make ep@@ ic win@@ s so possible in online wor@@ l@@ ds .
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these online g@@ ames , e@@ speci@@ ally in World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft , there are lots and lots of different charac@@ ters who are wil@@ ling to tru@@ st you with a wor@@ l@@ d-@@ sa@@ ving mis@@ sion , right away .
But not just any mis@@ sion , it &apos;s a mis@@ sion that is perf@@ ec@@ tly mat@@ ched with your curr@@ ent level in the game .
Right ? So you can do it .
They never give you a challen@@ ge you can &apos;t ach@@ ieve .
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re cap@@ able of , so you have to try hard .
But there &apos;s no un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft ; no sitting around ,
wr@@ ing@@ ing your hands --
there &apos;s always something speci@@ fic and important to be done .
There are also t@@ ons of col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors .
E@@ very@@ where you go , hun@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of people ready to work with you to ach@@ ieve your ep@@ ic mis@@ sion .
That &apos;s not something we have in real life that eas@@ ily , this sense that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of col@@ labor@@ at@@ ors .
And there &apos;s this ep@@ ic story , this inspir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing ,
and we get all this pos@@ itive fe@@ ed@@ back .
You guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up , + 1 str@@ en@@ g@@ th , + 1 intelligen@@ ce .
We don &apos;t get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
When I get off this stage , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 spea@@ king , and + 1 cra@@ z@@ y idea , + 20 cra@@ z@@ y idea .
I don &apos;t get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
Now , the problem with col@@ labor@@ ative online environ@@ ments like World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft is that it &apos;s so s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win all the time , we deci@@ de to spend all our time in these game wor@@ l@@ ds .
It &apos;s just better than real@@ ity .
So , so far , collec@@ ti@@ vely all the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ zer@@ ot@@ h .
Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing .
It might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
But to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ lie@@ st pri@@ mate human anc@@ est@@ ors st@@ ood up .
That was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re cur@@ ren@@ tly inve@@ sting in pla@@ ying g@@ ames , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evolution , which is an ex@@ tra@@ ordinary thing .
But it &apos;s also ap@@ t , because it turns out that by sp@@ en@@ ding all this time pla@@ ying g@@ ames , we &apos;re actually chan@@ ging what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ings .
We &apos;re e@@ vol@@ ving to be a more col@@ labor@@ ative and he@@ ar@@ ty species .
This is true . I believe this .
So , consi@@ der this really interesting stati@@ stic ;
it was rec@@ ently publi@@ shed by a re@@ se@@ arch@@ er at Car@@ neg@@ ie M@@ el@@ l@@ on Uni@@ versity :
The aver@@ age young person today in a country with a str@@ ong g@@ am@@ er culture will have spent 10@@ ,000 hours pla@@ ying online g@@ ames by the age of 2@@ 1 .
Now 10@@ ,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reas@@ ons .
F@@ ir@@ st of all , for children in the United States , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school , from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to high school gra@@ du@@ ation , if you have perfect atten@@ d@@ ance .
So , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l tr@@ ack of education going on , where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they &apos;re learning about everything else in school .
Some of you have probably read M@@ al@@ col@@ m G@@ la@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; O@@ ut@@ li@@ ers , &quot;
so you would have heard of his theory of succ@@ ess , the &quot; 10@@ ,000 hours &quot; theory of succ@@ ess .
It &apos;s based on this great c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve@@ -@@ science research that says if we can ma@@ ster 10@@ ,000 hours of ef@@ for@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 2@@ 1 , we will be vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at it .
We will be as good at whatever we do as the gre@@ at@@ est people in the world .
And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire gener@@ ation of young people who are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ ers .
So , the big question is , &quot; What exactly are g@@ am@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
Because if we could figure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ prec@@ e@@ den@@ ted human resour@@ ce on our hands .
This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying online g@@ ames .
These are our vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ ers ,
500 million people who are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily good at something .
And in the next de@@ ca@@ de , we &apos;re going to have another billion g@@ am@@ ers who are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily good at whatever that is .
If you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
The game indu@@ stry is develop@@ ing con@@ s@@ o@@ les that are low@@ -@@ energy and that work with the w@@ ir@@ el@@ ess phone net@@ works instead of bro@@ ad@@ band Internet , so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the world , parti@@ cul@@ arly in India , China , Bra@@ zi@@ l , can get online .
They exp@@ ect one billion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next de@@ ca@@ de .
It will bring us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 billion g@@ am@@ ers .
So I &apos;ve started to think about what these g@@ ames are making us vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at .
Here are the four things I came up with . The first is ur@@ gen@@ t op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
OK , think of this as extre@@ me self-@@ moti@@ v@@ ation .
U@@ r@@ gen@@ t op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m is the de@@ si@@ re to act im@@ medi@@ ately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the bel@@ ief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of succ@@ ess .
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an ep@@ ic win is possible , and that it &apos;s always wor@@ th trying , and trying now .
G@@ am@@ ers don &apos;t s@@ it around .
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at we@@ a@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fab@@ ri@@ c .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ ad@@ ly .
And the reason is , it takes a lot of tru@@ st to play a game with someone .
We tru@@ st that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same ru@@ les , value the same go@@ al , sta@@ y with the game until it &apos;s over .
And so , pla@@ ying a game together actually buil@@ ds up b@@ onds and tru@@ st and coo@@ per@@ ation .
And we actually build str@@ on@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a resul@@ t .
B@@ li@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ vity . I love it .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the aver@@ age World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 hours a week -- kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re pla@@ ying a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rel@@ a@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
We know that we are op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed as human be@@ ings , to do hard and mean@@ ing@@ ful work .
And g@@ am@@ ers are wil@@ ling to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
F@@ in@@ ally : ep@@ ic mean@@ ing .
G@@ am@@ ers love to be at@@ ta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ inspir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
So , just one bit of tri@@ via that hel@@ ps put that into perspec@@ tive :
So , you all know W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia , bi@@ gge@@ st wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
S@@ ec@@ ond bi@@ gge@@ st wi@@ k@@ i in the world , with ne@@ arly 8@@ 0,000 ar@@ tic@@ les , is the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft wi@@ k@@ i .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every m@@ ont@@ h .
They have comp@@ i@@ led more information about World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft on the Internet than any other top@@ ic c@@ over@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
They are building an ep@@ ic story .
They are building an ep@@ ic knowledge resour@@ ce about the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft .
Okay , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that ad@@ d up to one thing :
G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ power@@ ed hop@@ ef@@ ul individu@@ als .
These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally cap@@ able of chan@@ ging the world .
And the only problem is , they believe that they are cap@@ able of chan@@ ging vir@@ tual wor@@ l@@ ds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
There &apos;s an econom@@ ist nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ ward C@@ a@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ v@@ a .
H@@ is work is br@@ illi@@ ant . He looks at why people are inve@@ sting so much time and energy and money in online wor@@ l@@ ds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re wit@@ ne@@ ss@@ ing what am@@ oun@@ ts to no less than a ma@@ ss ex@@ o@@ dus to vir@@ tual wor@@ l@@ ds and online game environ@@ ments . &quot;
And he &apos;s an econom@@ ist , so he &apos;s r@@ ational .
And he says -- Not like me , I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner ; I &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
But he says that this makes perfect sense , because g@@ am@@ ers can ach@@ ieve more in online wor@@ l@@ ds than they can in real life .
They can have str@@ on@@ ger social relation@@ shi@@ ps in g@@ ames than they can have in real life ;
they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in g@@ ames than they do in real life .
So he says , for now it makes perfect sense for g@@ am@@ ers to spend more time in vir@@ tual wor@@ l@@ ds than the real world .
Now , I also a@@ gre@@ e that that is r@@ ational , for now .
But it is not , by any means , an op@@ ti@@ m@@ al situ@@ ation .
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
I take my inspir@@ ation from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago .
These are anci@@ ent di@@ ce , made out of s@@ he@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les .
B@@ ef@@ ore we had a@@ we@@ some game contro@@ l@@ l@@ ers , we had s@@ he@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les .
And these re@@ present the first game equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment desig@@ ned by human be@@ ings ,
and if you &apos;re fam@@ ili@@ ar with the work of the anci@@ ent G@@ ree@@ k hi@@ stor@@ ian H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history ,
which is the history of who inven@@ ted g@@ ames and why .
H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us says that g@@ ames , parti@@ cul@@ arly di@@ ce g@@ ames , were inven@@ ted in the k@@ ing@@ dom of L@@ y@@ dia , during a time of fam@@ ine .
A@@ p@@ par@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ dia decided they had to do something cra@@ z@@ y .
People were su@@ ff@@ ering . People were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
It was an extre@@ me situ@@ ation , they needed an extre@@ me solution .
So , ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , they inven@@ ted di@@ ce g@@ ames , and they set up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ wi@@ de po@@ lic@@ y :
O@@ n one day , everybody would eat ,
and on the next day , everybody would play g@@ ames .
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ sed in pla@@ ying the di@@ ce g@@ ames , because g@@ ames are so en@@ ga@@ ging , and im@@ mer@@ se us in such s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying , bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ vity , they would ig@@ nor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .
And then on the next day , they would play g@@ ames ;
and on the next day , they would eat .
And ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , they pas@@ sed 18 years this way ,
survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine , by e@@ ating on one day , and pla@@ ying g@@ ames on the next .
Now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using g@@ ames today . We &apos;re using g@@ ames to esc@@ ape real@@ -@@ world su@@ ff@@ ering --
we &apos;re using g@@ ames to get away
from everything that &apos;s bro@@ ken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from g@@ ames .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
This is really exc@@ iting .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better ,
so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce game .
They divi@@ ded the entire k@@ ing@@ dom in half .
They pla@@ yed one di@@ ce game , and the win@@ ners of that game got to go on an ep@@ ic ad@@ ven@@ ture .
They would leave L@@ y@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live ,
lea@@ ving behind just enough people to survi@@ ve on the resour@@ ces that were a@@ va@@ il@@ able , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly to take their civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation some@@ where else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
Now , this s@@ ounds cra@@ z@@ y , right ?
But rec@@ ently , DNA evi@@ dence has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tru@@ sc@@ ans , who then led to the R@@ oman E@@ mp@@ ire , actually share the same DNA as the anci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ ans .
And so , rec@@ ently , scienti@@ sts have sugge@@ sted that H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us &apos; cra@@ z@@ y story is actually true .
And ge@@ ologi@@ sts have found evi@@ dence of a global coo@@ ling that la@@ sted for ne@@ arly 20 years , that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine .
So this cra@@ z@@ y story might be true .
They might have actually sa@@ ved their culture by pla@@ ying g@@ ames , esc@@ ap@@ ing to g@@ ames for 18 years , and then been so in@@ spi@@ red , and knew so much about how to come together with g@@ ames , that they actually sa@@ ved the entire civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation that way .
Okay , we can do that .
We &apos;ve been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft since 199@@ 4 .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time strateg@@ y game from the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft ser@@ ies . That was 1@@ 6 years ago .
They pla@@ yed di@@ ce g@@ ames for 18 years , we &apos;ve been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft for 1@@ 6 years .
I say we are ready for our own ep@@ ic game .
Now , they had half the civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation go off in search of a new world ,
so that &apos;s where I get my 2@@ 1 billion hours a week of ga@@ me@@ -@@ play from .
Let &apos;s get half of us to a@@ gre@@ e to spend an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying g@@ ames , until we sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problems .
Now , I know you &apos;re as@@ king , &quot; How are we going to sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problems in g@@ ames ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve dev@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the In@@ stitu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture .
We have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , and it ex@@ press@@ es our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
We do not want to try to predic@@ t the future .
What we want to do is make the future .
We want to imagine the be@@ st-@@ case sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o out@@ come ,
and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a real@@ ity .
We want to imagine ep@@ ic win@@ s , and then give people the means to ach@@ ieve the ep@@ ic win .
I &apos;m just going to very br@@ ie@@ fly show you three g@@ ames that I &apos;ve made that are an at@@ temp@@ t to give people the means to create ep@@ ic win@@ s in their own fu@@ tures .
This is World W@@ i@@ th@@ out O@@ il .
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an online game in which you try to survi@@ ve an oil sh@@ or@@ tage .
The oil sh@@ or@@ tage is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online cont@@ ent out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . So when you come to the game , you sig@@ n up , tell us where you live ,
and then we give you real@@ -@@ time news vide@@ os , data fe@@ eds that show you exactly how much oil co@@ sts , what &apos;s not a@@ va@@ il@@ able , how food su@@ pp@@ ly is being aff@@ ected , how transp@@ or@@ tation is being aff@@ ected , if sch@@ ools are clos@@ ed , if there &apos;s ri@@ ot@@ ing ,
and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . And then we ask you to b@@ log about it , to p@@ ost vide@@ os , to p@@ ost photo@@ s .
We p@@ il@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 pla@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 7 ,
and we &apos;ve trac@@ ked them for the three years since .
And I can tell you that this is a transform@@ ative experience .
No@@ body wan@@ ts to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re sup@@ posed to .
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an ep@@ ic ad@@ ven@@ ture and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve run out of oil .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ ven@@ ture for you to go on .
Ch@@ allen@@ ge yourself to see how you would survi@@ ve , &quot;
most of our pla@@ y@@ ers have ke@@ pt up the ha@@ b@@ its that they learned in this game .
So for the next wor@@ l@@ d-@@ sa@@ ving game , we decided to a@@ im high@@ er -- bi@@ gger problem than just pe@@ a@@ k oil .
We did a game called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ stitu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture .
And the pre@@ mi@@ se was , a super@@ computer has cal@@ cul@@ ated that humans have only 2@@ 3 years left on the planet .
This super@@ computer was called the G@@ lob@@ al Ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess S@@ y@@ stem , of course .
We asked people to come online -- almost like a J@@ er@@ ry B@@ ru@@ c@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mov@@ ie .
You know J@@ er@@ ry B@@ ru@@ c@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mov@@ ies , you form a dre@@ am team --
you &apos;ve got the a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ ut , the scienti@@ st , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ v@@ ic@@ t , and they all have something to do to sa@@ ve the world .
But in our game , instead of just having five people on the dre@@ am team , we said , &quot; E@@ very@@ body &apos;s on the dre@@ am team , and it &apos;s your job to inv@@ ent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of sec@@ ur@@ ity and the future of the social sa@@ fe@@ ty net . &quot;
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
They came up with 500 in@@ s@@ an@@ ely cre@@ ative solu@@ tions that you can go online , Google &quot; Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
So , finally , the last game , we &apos;re la@@ un@@ ching it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . This is a game done with the World B@@ ank In@@ stitu@@ te .
If you comple@@ te the game , you will be cer@@ ti@@ f@@ ied by the World B@@ ank In@@ stitu@@ te as a S@@ oc@@ ial In@@ nov@@ ator , cla@@ ss of 20@@ 10 .
Wor@@ king with univers@@ ities all over sub@@ -@@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa , and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innov@@ ation sk@@ il@@ ls .
We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hi@@ c nov@@ el , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ il@@ ls like loc@@ al in@@ si@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability , vi@@ sion and resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
I would like to inv@@ ite all of you to p@@ lea@@ se share this game with young people , any@@ where in the world , parti@@ cul@@ arly in develop@@ ing areas , who might ben@@ ef@@ it from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social en@@ ter@@ pri@@ ses to sa@@ ve the world .
So , I &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think happens next ?
We &apos;ve got all these amazing g@@ am@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these g@@ ames that are kind of p@@ il@@ ots of what we might do , but n@@ one of them have sa@@ ved the real world yet .
Well I hope you will a@@ gre@@ e with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human resour@@ ce that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work , that g@@ ames are a powerful plat@@ form for change .
We have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s : bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ vity , the ability to we@@ a@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fab@@ ri@@ c , this fe@@ eling of ur@@ gen@@ t op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and the de@@ si@@ re for ep@@ ic mean@@ ing .
I really hope that we can come together to play g@@ ames that matter , to survi@@ ve on this planet for another century .
That &apos;s my hope , that you will jo@@ in me in making and pla@@ ying g@@ ames like this .
When I look forward to the next de@@ ca@@ de , I know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any g@@ ames we want , so I say :
Let the wor@@ l@@ d-@@ chan@@ ging g@@ ames begin .
Thank you .
For some time I have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect ,
which might se@@ em like an o@@ d@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interested in , un@@ less you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; S@@ ome@@ thing fa@@ ke is belie@@ ved in enough by somebody that it be@@ comes something real . &quot; In other words , su@@ ga@@ r p@@ il@@ ls have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of stu@@ dies , the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect ,
just because the person thin@@ ks that what &apos;s happening to them is a ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical or some sort of a --
for pa@@ in man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect .
S@@ ome@@ thing fa@@ ke be@@ comes something real because of someone &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tion of it .
In order for us to understand each other , I want to start by sho@@ wing you a ru@@ dimen@@ t@@ ary , very simple ma@@ gic tr@@ ick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a tr@@ ick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s ma@@ gic book since at least the 19@@ 5@@ 0s .
I learned it myself from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out Ma@@ gic in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll expla@@ in it .
And then I &apos;ll expla@@ in why I expla@@ ined it .
So , here &apos;s what happens .
The k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
I &apos;m just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my fi@@ st like this .
I &apos;ll get my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve I &apos;m just going to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here .
That way you can see that at no time
can anything tra@@ vel , as long as I &apos;m squ@@ e@@ e@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve .
And the object of this is quite simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , if all is well , my p@@ ure animal mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m will hold the k@@ ni@@ fe .
In fact it &apos;s h@@ eld so ti@@ gh@@ tly in place that I can sha@@ ke it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
No@@ thing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , no tr@@ ic@@ ker@@ y . And you can exam@@ ine everything .
Ta@@ -@@ da !
So , this is a tr@@ ick that I often te@@ ach to young children that are interested in ma@@ gic , because you can learn a great deal about de@@ cep@@ tion by stu@@ d@@ ying
this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple tr@@ ick meth@@ o@@ dol@@ og@@ ically .
Pro@@ b@@ ably many of you in the room know this tr@@ ick .
What happens is this .
I hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand .
I say I &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my w@@ ri@@ st to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve ,
that is a lie .
The reason I &apos;m hol@@ ding on@@ to my w@@ ri@@ st is because that &apos;s actually the sec@@ r@@ et of the illu@@ sion .
In a moment when my hand mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you , this f@@ ing@@ er right here , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is , to a pos@@ ition
poin@@ ting out like this . N@@ ice one . S@@ ome@@ one who didn &apos;t have a chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood is out there .
So , it goes like this , from here , right .
And as I move around my f@@ ing@@ er shi@@ f@@ ts .
And we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t not@@ ice there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here ,
because the mind , and the way it proc@@ ess@@ es information , it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t , one , two , three . It grou@@ ps them .
But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Right ? And then I open my hand up .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously it &apos;s cl@@ ing@@ ing there , not by animal mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er being there .
And then when I close my f@@ ing@@ er , same thing ,
as I move back , this mot@@ ion kind of c@@ over@@ s the moving back of my f@@ ing@@ er .
I take this hand away . You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
There is a tr@@ ick you can do for your friends and ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ s . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wi@@ de open .
I &apos;m not a doc@@ tor or a re@@ se@@ arch@@ er , so this , to me , was an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing .
It turns out that if you ad@@ min@@ ister a plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like a@@ spir@@ in sh@@ ap@@ ed -- it &apos;s just a r@@ ound white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in , like you make a sm@@ all@@ er p@@ ill , and col@@ or it bl@@ ue , and st@@ am@@ p a let@@ ter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effec@@ tive .
E@@ ven though ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical -- they &apos;re su@@ ga@@ r p@@ il@@ ls .
But a white p@@ ill is not as good as a bl@@ ue p@@ ill .
What ? That really f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed me out .
T@@ ur@@ ns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stop@@ s .
If you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effec@@ tive than t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts in any form .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this .
One p@@ ill tw@@ ice a day is not as good at three p@@ il@@ ls -- I don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . S@@ or@@ ry .
But the point is ...
... these d@@ os@@ a@@ ges have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
And if you want the ul@@ ti@@ mate in plac@@ e@@ b@@ o , you &apos;ve go to the ne@@ ed@@ le .
Right ? A sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge with some in@@ ert -- a couple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert something , and you in@@ ject this into a pati@@ ent ...
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind ,
it &apos;s so much str@@ on@@ ger than the white p@@ ill .
It &apos;s a really , this grap@@ h , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
The point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the bl@@ ue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the ne@@ ed@@ le .
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical qu@@ ality ,
it &apos;s only your bel@@ ief that makes it real in your body and makes a str@@ on@@ ger effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and app@@ ly it to a ma@@ gic tr@@ ick .
And take something that is obvi@@ ously a fa@@ ke tr@@ ick and make it se@@ em real .
And we know from that study that when you want real@@ ity , you go to the ne@@ ed@@ le .
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in . It &apos;s very , very sh@@ ar@@ p ,
and I &apos;m going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tin@@ y bit .
This is really my fle@@ sh . This is not D@@ am@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fle@@ sh .
That &apos;s my sk@@ in right there . This is not a H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood spec@@ ial effect .
I &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my sk@@ in and run this ne@@ ed@@ le through to the other side .
If you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ int eas@@ ily -- I was doing this for some friends in the h@@ ot@@ el room last night , and some people that I didn &apos;t know ,
and one woman almost pas@@ sed out .
So , I sugge@@ st if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
So , here is what happens , right here ,
the beginning of my fle@@ sh at the lo@@ wer part of my arm I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry , man . A@@ m I f@@ rea@@ king you out ?
OK , and then just through my sk@@ in a tin@@ y bit , and then out the other side like this .
Now , essenti@@ ally we &apos;re in the same pos@@ ition we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tr@@ ick .
S@@ ort of .
But you can &apos;t coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
Yes , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
They go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s certain@@ ly not du@@ m@@ b enough to sta@@ b hi@@ m@@ self through the sk@@ in to en@@ ter@@ tain us for a few minutes . So , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
How &apos;s that look out there ? P@@ re@@ t@@ ty good .
Yeah , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot; People in the s@@ at@@ el@@ lit@@ e room are starting to move in now .
Let me give you good close look at this .
That really is my sk@@ in . That is not a H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood spec@@ ial effect .
That &apos;s my fle@@ sh , and I can t@@ wist that around .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry . If you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
People in the back or people on video years from now wat@@ ching this will go , &quot; Well ye@@ ah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ e@@ ding . Well let me work up some bl@@ ood for you .
Yes , there it is .
Nor@@ m@@ ally now , I would take the ne@@ ed@@ le out .
I would cle@@ an off my arm , and I would show you that there are no w@@ ounds .
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
I will be seeing you sever@@ al times over the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve lo@@ ved only two .
That first one , it was more like a pas@@ sion@@ ate aff@@ air .
It was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , te@@ x@@ tu@@ red , me@@ at@@ y , a be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler on the men@@ u .
What a fish .
E@@ ven better , it was far@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the sup@@ posed hi@@ g@@ he@@ st stand@@ ar@@ ds of su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
So you could feel good about sel@@ ling it .
I was in a relation@@ ship with this beau@@ ty for sever@@ al months .
One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d spea@@ k at an ev@@ ent about the f@@ arm &apos;s su@@ sta@@ in@@ ability .
&quot; A@@ b@@ solu@@ tely , &quot; I said .
Here was a company trying to sol@@ ve what &apos;s become this uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able problem for us ch@@ ef@@ s :
How do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been f@@ ish@@ ing the se@@ as like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ cut for@@ est@@ s .
It &apos;s hard to over@@ state the de@@ struc@@ tion .
N@@ in@@ e@@ ty percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the s@@ al@@ m@@ ons , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve col@@ lap@@ sed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , for better or for wor@@ se , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
A lot of argu@@ ments against it :
F@@ ish far@@ ms pol@@ lu@@ te -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they &apos;re in@@ effici@@ ent . Ta@@ ke tun@@ a ,
a maj@@ or dra@@ w@@ back .
It &apos;s got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 15 to one .
That means it takes fi@@ f@@ t@@ een p@@ ounds of wil@@ d fish to get you one p@@ ound of f@@ arm tun@@ a .
Not very su@@ sta@@ in@@ able .
It doesn &apos;t ta@@ ste very good either .
So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to sup@@ port them .
The day before the ev@@ ent , I called the head of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the company .
Let &apos;s call him D@@ on .
&quot; D@@ on , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the fac@@ ts stra@@ ight , you guys are fam@@ ous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pol@@ lu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the wa@@ ste from our fish gets di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted , not con@@ centr@@ ated . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said . &quot; B@@ est in the business . &quot;
2@@ .@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2@@ .@@ 5 what ? What are you fe@@ e@@ ding ? &quot;
&quot; Su@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s , &quot; he said .
&quot; Gre@@ at , &quot; I said . G@@ ot off the phone .
And that night , I was l@@ ying in bed , and I thought : What the hel@@ l is a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ e@@ in ?
So the next day , just before the ev@@ ent , I called D@@ on .
I said , &quot; D@@ on , what are some exam@@ p@@ les of su@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know . He would ask around .
Well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ;
no one could give me a stra@@ ight answer
until finally , I got on the phone with the head bi@@ ologi@@ st .
Let &apos;s call him D@@ on too .
&quot; D@@ on , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some exam@@ p@@ les of su@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ ein@@ s ? &quot;
Well , he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts .
I said , &quot; Ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , sk@@ in , b@@ one me@@ al , sc@@ r@@ aps , dr@@ ied and proc@@ ess@@ ed into fe@@ ed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What per@@ cen@@ tage of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ic@@ ken ? &quot;
Th@@ in@@ king , you know , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; D@@ on , what &apos;s su@@ sta@@ in@@ able about fe@@ e@@ ding ch@@ ic@@ ken to fish ? &quot;
There was a long p@@ ause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much ch@@ ic@@ ken in the world . &quot;
I f@@ ell out of love with this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , g@@ ood@@ y-@@ two sho@@ es foo@@ die .
I actually am .
No , I actually f@@ ell out of love with this fish because , I s@@ we@@ ar to God , after that con@@ vers@@ ation , the fish tast@@ ed like ch@@ ic@@ ken .
This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
It &apos;s the rom@@ an@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in .
A jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
She kind of set us up .
It came to the table a b@@ right , almost shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing , white col@@ or .
The ch@@ ef had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
Li@@ ke tw@@ ice over .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ingly , it was still del@@ ici@@ ous .
Wh@@ o can make a fish ta@@ ste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Let &apos;s call him M@@ ig@@ u@@ el --
actually his name is M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
And no , he didn &apos;t c@@ ook the fish , and he &apos;s not a ch@@ ef ,
at least in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a bi@@ ologi@@ st at V@@ et@@ a L@@ a P@@ al@@ ma .
It &apos;s a fish f@@ arm in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n cor@@ ner of S@@ pa@@ in .
It &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver .
Un@@ til the 19@@ 8@@ 0s , the f@@ arm was in the hands of the Ar@@ gen@@ tin@@ i@@ ans .
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ ef cat@@ tle on what was essenti@@ ally we@@ t@@ land@@ s .
They did it by dra@@ ining the land .
They built this in@@ tr@@ ic@@ ate ser@@ ies of can@@ als , and they p@@ us@@ hed water off the land and out into the ri@@ ver .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
And ec@@ olog@@ ically , it was a di@@ sa@@ ster .
It kil@@ led like 90 percent of the bir@@ ds ,
which , for this place , is a lot of bir@@ ds .
And so in 19@@ 8@@ 2 , a S@@ pan@@ ish company with an environ@@ mental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the land .
What did they do ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of water .
They literally f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed the s@@ wit@@ ch .
In@@ ste@@ ad of pu@@ sh@@ ing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pul@@ l water back in .
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish f@@ arm -- bas@@ s , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , eel -- and in the process , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ olog@@ ical de@@ struc@@ tion .
The f@@ arm &apos;s incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
You st@@ are out at a hor@@ iz@@ on that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick , r@@ ich mar@@ sh@@ land .
I was there not long ago with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
He &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Char@@ les Dar@@ win and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e .
Okay ? There we are s@@ log@@ ging through the we@@ t@@ land@@ s , and I &apos;m pan@@ ting and s@@ we@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and M@@ ig@@ u@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a biolog@@ y lec@@ ture .
Here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ ed K@@ ite .
Now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al needs of ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
And here , here he se@@ es a grou@@ ping patter@@ n that re@@ min@@ ds him of the T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ ian G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
It turns out , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el spent the better part of his car@@ eer in the M@@ ik@@ um@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an ex@@ per@@ t on fish .
He said , &quot; F@@ ish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
I &apos;m an ex@@ per@@ t in relation@@ shi@@ ps . &quot;
And then he &apos;s off , la@@ un@@ ching into more talk about r@@ are bir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and str@@ an@@ ge a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c plan@@ ts .
And don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascin@@ ating , you know , the bi@@ ot@@ ic community un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ ged , kind of thing .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my head was s@@ w@@ oon@@ ing over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of del@@ ici@@ ous fish I had the night before .
So I inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted him . I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , what makes your fish ta@@ ste so good ? &quot;
He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; I know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relation@@ shi@@ ps : It &apos;s amazing .
But what are your fish e@@ ating ?
What &apos;s the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o ? &quot;
Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a r@@ ich system that the fish are e@@ ating what they &apos;d be e@@ ating in the wil@@ d .
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s , the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the z@@ oo@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ eds the fish .
The system is so heal@@ thy , it &apos;s tot@@ ally self-@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
There is no fe@@ ed .
E@@ ver heard of a f@@ arm that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals ?
L@@ ater that day , I was dri@@ ving around this pro@@ per@@ ty with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seem@@ s so natural , un@@ like like any f@@ arm I &apos;d ever been at , how do you meas@@ ure succ@@ ess ? &quot;
At that moment , it was as if a film direc@@ tor called for a set change .
And we r@@ oun@@ ded the cor@@ ner and saw the most amazing si@@ ght : thousands and thousands of p@@ in@@ k fla@@ min@@ go@@ s , a liter@@ al p@@ in@@ k car@@ p@@ et for as far as you could see .
&quot; That &apos;s succ@@ ess , &quot; he said .
&quot; L@@ ook at their bel@@ l@@ ies , p@@ in@@ k .
They &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
F@@ ea@@ sting ? I was tot@@ ally conf@@ used .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; We l@@ ose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to bir@@ ds .
Well , last year , this pro@@ per@@ ty had 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 bir@@ ds on it , more than 2@@ 50 different species .
It &apos;s become , today , the lar@@ ge@@ st and one of the most important priv@@ ate b@@ ird s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of Europ@@ e . &quot;
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , isn &apos;t a th@@ ri@@ ving b@@ ird population like the last thing you want on a fish f@@ arm ? &quot;
He sh@@ ook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We f@@ arm ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ si@@ vely .
This is an ec@@ olog@@ ical net@@ work .
The fla@@ min@@ go@@ s eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
The sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
So the p@@ in@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
Okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view :
a f@@ arm that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals , and a f@@ arm that meas@@ ures its succ@@ ess on the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
A fish f@@ arm , but also a b@@ ird s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
Oh , and by the way , those fla@@ min@@ go@@ s , they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They br@@ ood in a to@@ wn 1@@ 50 miles away , where the s@@ oil condi@@ tions are better for building ne@@ sts .
E@@ very morning , they fly 1@@ 50 miles into the f@@ arm .
And every even@@ ing , they fly 1@@ 50 miles back .
They do that because they &apos;re able to fol@@ low the bro@@ ken white line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2 .
No k@@ id@@ ding .
I was ima@@ gin@@ ing a &quot; Mar@@ ch of the P@@ en@@ gu@@ ins &quot; thing , so I looked at M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , do they fly 1@@ 50 miles to the f@@ arm , and then do they fly 1@@ 50 miles back at night ?
Do they do that for the children ? &quot;
He looked at me like I had just quot@@ ed a Wh@@ it@@ ney H@@ ou@@ st@@ on s@@ ong .
He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ o@@ ved fish , which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don &apos;t like fish sk@@ in ;
I don &apos;t like it se@@ ared , I don &apos;t like it c@@ ri@@ sp@@ y .
It &apos;s that ac@@ ri@@ d , t@@ ar-@@ like fla@@ v@@ or .
I almost never c@@ ook with it .
Y@@ et , when I tast@@ ed it at that re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in , it tast@@ ed not at all like fish sk@@ in .
It tast@@ ed s@@ weet and cle@@ an , like you were taking a b@@ ite of the ocean .
I men@@ tion@@ ed that to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
He said , &quot; The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ on@@ ge .
It &apos;s the last de@@ fen@@ se before anything en@@ ters the body .
It e@@ volved to s@@ o@@ a@@ k up imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; But our water has no imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
OK . A f@@ arm that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its fish ,
a f@@ arm that meas@@ ures its succ@@ ess by the succ@@ ess of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
And then I realized when he says , &quot; A f@@ arm that has no imp@@ ur@@ ities , &quot; he made a big under@@ stat@@ e@@ ment , because the water that flo@@ ws through that f@@ arm comes in from the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver .
It &apos;s a ri@@ ver that car@@ r@@ ies with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to car@@ ry these days : chem@@ ical cont@@ am@@ in@@ ants , pe@@ st@@ ici@@ de ru@@ no@@ ff .
And when it works its way through the system and lea@@ ves , the water is cle@@ an@@ er than when it en@@ ter@@ ed .
The system is so heal@@ thy , it pur@@ i@@ f@@ ies the water .
So , not just a f@@ arm that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals , not just a f@@ arm that meas@@ ures its succ@@ ess by the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors , but a f@@ arm that &apos;s literally a water pur@@ i@@ fic@@ ation pl@@ ant --
and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
Because when that water lea@@ ves , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic .
A dro@@ p in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , ho@@ we@@ ver rom@@ an@@ tic , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
You might say it &apos;s a re@@ cip@@ e for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef cat@@ tle .
What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new con@@ cep@@ tion of a@@ gr@@ icul@@ ture , one in which the food actually tast@@ es good .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too ra@@ dic@@ al .
We &apos;re not real@@ ists , us foo@@ dies ;
we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
We love far@@ mers &apos; marke@@ ts ,
we love small family far@@ ms ,
we talk about loc@@ al food ,
we eat organ@@ ic .
And when you sugge@@ st these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , some@@ where stand@@ s up and says , &quot; H@@ ey guy , I love p@@ in@@ k fla@@ min@@ go@@ s , but how are you going to fe@@ ed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to fe@@ ed the world ?
Can I be hon@@ est ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
No , not because we already produc@@ e enough cal@@ or@@ ies to more than fe@@ ed the world .
One billion people will go hun@@ gr@@ y today .
One billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gr@@ os@@ s in@@ equ@@ al@@ ities in di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion , not ton@@ na@@ ge .
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pe@@ st@@ ic@@ ide@@ s to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , chem@@ ic@@ als to s@@ oil , ch@@ ic@@ ken to fish , and all along ag@@ ri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how ter@@ ri@@ ble could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the moti@@ v@@ ation ,
it &apos;s been the ju@@ sti@@ fic@@ ation :
it &apos;s been the business plan of American a@@ gr@@ icul@@ ture .
We should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation , a business that &apos;s quickly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ olog@@ ical cap@@ ital that makes that very produc@@ tion possible .
That &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t a@@ gr@@ icul@@ ture .
O@@ ur bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing su@@ pp@@ ly , but because of di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing resour@@ ces . Not by the l@@ at@@ est com@@ b@@ ine and trac@@ tor inven@@ tion , but by fer@@ t@@ ile land ; not by pu@@ mp@@ s , but by f@@ res@@ h water ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by for@@ est@@ s ; and not by f@@ ish@@ ing bo@@ ats and ne@@ ts , but by fish in the sea .
Want to fe@@ ed the world ?
Let &apos;s start by as@@ king : How are we going to fe@@ ed ourselves ?
Or better : How can we create condi@@ tions that en@@ able every community to fe@@ ed itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the ag@@ ri@@ business model for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
It &apos;s high on cap@@ ital , che@@ mi@@ stry and machines , and it &apos;s never produc@@ ed anything really good to eat .
In@@ ste@@ ad , let &apos;s look to the ec@@ olog@@ ical model .
That &apos;s the one that rel@@ ies on two billion years of on-@@ the@@ -@@ job experience .
L@@ ook to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , far@@ mers like M@@ ig@@ u@@ el . F@@ ar@@ ms that aren &apos;t wor@@ l@@ ds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that re@@ stor@@ e instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that f@@ arm ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vely ; far@@ mers that are not just produc@@ ers , but ex@@ per@@ ts in relation@@ shi@@ ps . Because they &apos;re the ones that are ex@@ per@@ ts in fla@@ v@@ or , too .
And if I &apos;m going to be really hon@@ est , they &apos;re a better ch@@ ef than I &apos;ll ever be .
You know , I &apos;m ok@@ ay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be del@@ ici@@ ous .
Thank you .
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ady di@@ et of science fic@@ tion .
In high school , I took a b@@ us to school an h@@ our each way every day .
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ bed in a book , science fic@@ tion book , which took my mind to other wor@@ l@@ ds , and s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied , in a n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative form , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sense of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity that I had .
And you know , that cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity also mani@@ fe@@ sted itself in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the w@@ oo@@ ds , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sa@@ mp@@ les &quot; -- fro@@ gs and s@@ na@@ kes and bu@@ gs and p@@ ond water -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it back , looking at it under the mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e .
You know , I was a real science ge@@ ek .
But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the lim@@ its of pos@@ sibility .
And my love of science fic@@ tion actually seem@@ ed m@@ ir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the l@@ ate &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the m@@ oon , we were expl@@ or@@ ing the de@@ ep oce@@ ans . J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living roo@@ ms with his amazing speci@@ als that sho@@ wed us animals and places and a w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ously ima@@ gin@@ ed .
So , that seem@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fic@@ tion part of it .
And I was an arti@@ st .
I could dra@@ w . I could pa@@ int .
And I found that because there wer@@ en &apos;t video g@@ ames and this s@@ at@@ ur@@ ation of C@@ G mov@@ ies and all of this ima@@ ger@@ y in the media land@@ sc@@ ape , I had to create these ima@@ ges in my head .
You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ p@@ tion , put something on the mov@@ ie scre@@ en in our he@@ ads .
And so , my respon@@ se to this was to pa@@ int , to dra@@ w al@@ ien creat@@ ures , al@@ ien wor@@ l@@ ds , robots , sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
I was end@@ le@@ ss@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in mat@@ h cla@@ ss d@@ ood@@ ling behind the te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
That was -- the creati@@ vity had to find its out@@ let some@@ how .
And an interesting thing happened : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very exc@@ ited about the fact that there was an al@@ ien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an al@@ ien world on a sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day --
that seem@@ ed pretty dar@@ n un@@ li@@ kel@@ y .
But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as r@@ ich and ex@@ ot@@ ic as anything that I had ima@@ gin@@ ed from rea@@ ding these books .
So , I decided I was going to become a sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
And the only problem with that was that I li@@ ved in a little vil@@ lage in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , 6@@ 00 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
But I didn &apos;t let that da@@ un@@ t me .
I pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ ub@@ a cla@@ ss in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ f@@ ied in a p@@ ool at a Y@@ M@@ CA in the de@@ ad of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York .
And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we mo@@ ved to Californi@@ a .
S@@ in@@ ce then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ b@@ les .
And I &apos;ve learned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the sh@@ al@@ low oce@@ ans , are so r@@ ich with amazing life that really is be@@ y@@ ond our ima@@ gin@@ ation .
Nat@@ ure &apos;s ima@@ gin@@ ation is so b@@ ound@@ less comp@@ ared to our own me@@ a@@ ger human ima@@ gin@@ ation .
I still , to this day , stand in absolu@@ te a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves .
And my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as str@@ ong as it ever was .
But when I ch@@ ose a car@@ eer as an ad@@ ul@@ t , it was fil@@ m@@ making .
And that seem@@ ed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ c@@ ile this ur@@ ge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create ima@@ ges .
And I was , as a k@@ id , con@@ stan@@ tly dra@@ wing com@@ ic books , and so on .
So , fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pic@@ tures and stories together , and that made sense .
And of course the stories that I ch@@ ose to tell were science fic@@ tion stories : &quot; Ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; A@@ li@@ ens &quot; and &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
And with &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss , &quot; I was pu@@ tting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ making .
So , you know , mer@@ ging the two pas@@ sions .
S@@ ome@@ thing interesting came out of &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to sol@@ ve a speci@@ fic n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water creat@@ ure , we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anim@@ ation , C@@ G .
And this resul@@ ted in the first sof@@ t-@@ surface charac@@ ter , C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a mov@@ ie .
And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely bro@@ ke even , I should say -- I wit@@ ne@@ ss@@ ed something amazing , which is that the audi@@ ence , the global audi@@ ence , was mes@@ mer@@ ized by this appar@@ ent ma@@ gic .
You know , it &apos;s Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s la@@ w that any su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ently ad@@ van@@ ced technology is in@@ dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from ma@@ gic .
They were seeing something mag@@ ical .
And so that got me very exc@@ ited .
And I thought , &quot; W@@ ow , this is something that needs to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ ati@@ c art . &quot;
So , with &quot; Ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M , we created the li@@ qu@@ id me@@ tal du@@ de in that film . The succ@@ ess hun@@ g in the bal@@ ance on whether that effect would work .
And it did , and we created ma@@ gic again ,
and we had the same resul@@ t with an audi@@ ence --
al@@ though we did make a little more money on that one .
So , dra@@ wing a line through those two d@@ ots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creati@@ vity for film arti@@ sts .
So , I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , my good friend St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and creat@@ ure desig@@ ner at that time , and it was called D@@ ig@@ ital D@@ om@@ a@@ in .
And the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the anal@@ o@@ g proc@@ ess@@ es of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to dig@@ ital produc@@ tion .
And we actually did that and it gave us a compe@@ tit@@ i@@ ve ad@@ van@@ tage for a while .
But we found ourselves la@@ g@@ ging in the m@@ id &apos; 9@@ 0s in the creat@@ ure and charac@@ ter design stuff that we had actually f@@ oun@@ ded the company to do .
So , I wrote this piece called &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was me@@ ant to absolu@@ tely p@@ ush the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visu@@ al effec@@ ts , of C@@ G effec@@ ts , be@@ y@@ ond , with real@@ ist@@ ic human emot@@ i@@ ve charac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G , and the ma@@ in charac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G , and the world would be in C@@ G . And the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e p@@ us@@ hed back ,
and I was told by the fol@@ ks at my company that we wer@@ en &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
So , I s@@ hel@@ ved it , and I made this other mov@@ ie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
You know , I went and p@@ it@@ ched it to the stu@@ di@@ o as &quot; &apos; R@@ ome@@ o and Ju@@ liet &apos; on a ship :
&quot; It &apos;s going to be this ep@@ ic rom@@ ance , pas@@ sion@@ ate film . &quot;
S@@ ec@@ re@@ tly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I made the mov@@ ie .
And that &apos;s the tru@@ th . Now , the stu@@ di@@ o didn &apos;t know that .
But I con@@ vin@@ ced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k . We &apos;re going to film it for real .
We &apos;ll be using it in the open@@ ing of the film .
It will be really important . It will be a great marke@@ ting h@@ ook . &quot;
And I talked them into fun@@ ding an ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tion .
S@@ ounds cra@@ z@@ y . But this goes back to that the@@ me about your ima@@ gin@@ ation cre@@ ating a real@@ ity .
Because we actually created a real@@ ity where six months later , I find myself in a Rus@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the nor@@ th A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic , looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a view port . Not a mov@@ ie , not H@@ D -- for real .
Now , that ble@@ w my mind .
And it took a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation , we had to build cam@@ er@@ as and li@@ ghts and all kinds of things .
But , it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve , these de@@ ep di@@ ves , was like a space mis@@ sion .
You know , where it was high@@ ly tech@@ n@@ ical , and it requ@@ i@@ red enor@@ m@@ ous plan@@ ning .
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dar@@ k ho@@ st@@ ile environment where there is no hope of re@@ sc@@ ue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
And I thought like , &quot; W@@ ow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fic@@ tion mov@@ ie .
This is really cool . &quot;
And so , I really got b@@ itten by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ ocean expl@@ or@@ ation .
Of course , the cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , the science comp@@ on@@ ent of it --
it was everything . It was ad@@ ven@@ ture , it was cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , it was ima@@ gin@@ ation . And it was an experience that H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood couldn &apos;t give me .
Because , you know , I could imagine a creat@@ ure and we could create a visu@@ al effect for it . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that win@@ do@@ w .
As we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , I was seeing creat@@ ures at hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ m@@ al ven@@ ts and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not descri@@ bed by science at the time that we saw them and ima@@ ged them .
So , I was completely sm@@ itten by this , and had to do more .
And so , I actually made a kind of cur@@ ious deci@@ sion .
Af@@ ter the succ@@ ess of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to par@@ k my day job as a H@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood mov@@ ie ma@@ ker , and I &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l-@@ time expl@@ or@@ er for a while . &quot;
And so , we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
And we w@@ ound up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k , and expl@@ or@@ ing it with robot@@ ic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k .
We took little bot@@ s that we had created that sp@@ oo@@ led a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ ve@@ y of that ship , which had never been done .
No@@ body had ever looked inside the w@@ rec@@ k . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
So , you know , here I am now , on the dec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had pla@@ yed .
And I &apos;m fl@@ ying a little robot@@ ic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
When I say , &quot; I &apos;m oper@@ ating it , &quot; but my mind is in the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le . I f@@ elt like I was phys@@ ically present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the li@@ ghts of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it , because I had wal@@ ked the set for months when we were making the mov@@ ie .
And the set was based as an ex@@ act re@@ p@@ lic@@ a on the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
So , it was this absolu@@ tely re@@ mark@@ able experience .
And it really made me re@@ alize that the tel@@ e@@ presen@@ ce experience -- that you actually can have these robot@@ ic av@@ at@@ ars , then your con@@ sci@@ ou@@ sne@@ ss is in@@ jec@@ ted into the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le , into this other form of ex@@ ist@@ ence .
It was really , really quite pro@@ found .
And it may be a little bit of a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some de@@ ca@@ des out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bo@@ dies for expl@@ or@@ ation or for other means in many sort of po@@ st-@@ human fu@@ tures that I can imagine , as a science fic@@ tion f@@ an .
So , having done these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , and really beginning to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the de@@ ep ocean ven@@ ts where we had these amazing , amazing animals --
they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on Earth .
They live in an environment of chem@@ osy@@ n@@ the@@ s@@ is .
They don &apos;t survi@@ ve on s@@ un@@ li@@ gh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 5@@ 0@@ 0-@@ de@@ gre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de water pl@@ u@@ mes .
You think they can &apos;t pos@@ si@@ bly ex@@ ist .
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fic@@ tion inf@@ lu@@ ence , as a k@@ id .
And I w@@ ound up getting in@@ volved with the space community , really in@@ volved with N@@ A@@ S@@ A , sitting on the N@@ A@@ S@@ A ad@@ vis@@ or@@ y board , plan@@ ning ac@@ tual space mis@@ sions , going to Rus@@ sia , going through the pre@@ -@@ c@@ os@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ ome@@ dic@@ al prot@@ oc@@ ol@@ s , and all these sor@@ ts of things , to actually go and fly to the inter@@ national space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D camera systems .
And this was fascin@@ ating .
But what I w@@ ound up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing space scienti@@ sts with us into the de@@ ep .
And taking them down so that they had acc@@ ess -- ast@@ ro@@ bi@@ ologi@@ sts , plan@@ et@@ ary scienti@@ sts , people who were interested in these extre@@ me environ@@ ments -- taking them down to the ven@@ ts , and le@@ tting them see , and take sa@@ mp@@ les and test instru@@ ments , and so on .
So , here we were making docu@@ ment@@ ary fil@@ ms , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I &apos;d completely clos@@ ed the loop between being the science fic@@ tion f@@ an , you know , as a k@@ id , and doing this stuff for real .
And you know , along the way in this jour@@ ney of disc@@ o@@ very , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about lea@@ der@@ ship .
Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a lea@@ der , lea@@ der of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really learn about lea@@ der@@ ship until I did these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
Because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Why am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;
We don &apos;t make money at these da@@ m@@ n shows .
We bar@@ ely brea@@ k even . There is no fa@@ me in it .
People sort of think I went away between &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic &quot; and &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ place , sitting at the be@@ ach .
Ma@@ de all these fil@@ ms , made all these docu@@ ment@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very lim@@ ited audi@@ ence .
No fa@@ me , no g@@ l@@ or@@ y , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the t@@ ask itself , for the challen@@ ge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment there is -- for the th@@ r@@ ill of disc@@ o@@ very , and for that str@@ an@@ ge b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ gh@@ tly k@@ n@@ it team .
Because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time ,
sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
And in that b@@ ond , you re@@ alize that the most important thing is the resp@@ ect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a t@@ ask that you can &apos;t expla@@ in to someone else .
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the atten@@ tu@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce a@@ spec@@ ts of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t expla@@ in it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in com@@ b@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never expla@@ in it .
C@@ re@@ ates a b@@ ond , cre@@ ates a b@@ ond of resp@@ ect .
So , when I came back to make my next mov@@ ie , which was &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; I tried to app@@ ly that same prin@@ ci@@ ple of lea@@ der@@ ship , which is that you resp@@ ect your team , and you ear@@ n their resp@@ ect in re@@ turn .
And it really changed the dynam@@ ic .
So , here I was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y , doing &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t ex@@ ist before .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ously exc@@ iting .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ously challen@@ ging .
And we became a family , over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ half year peri@@ od .
And it completely changed how I do mov@@ ies .
So , people have com@@ men@@ ted on how , &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organis@@ ms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
To me , it was more of a funda@@ mental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a resul@@ t of that .
So , what can we syn@@ the@@ size out of all this ?
You know , what are the le@@ ss@@ ons learned ?
Well , I think number one is cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
I@@ ma@@ gin@@ ation is a force that can actually mani@@ fe@@ st a real@@ ity .
And the resp@@ ect of your team is more important than all the la@@ ur@@ els in the world .
I have young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ kers come up to me and say , &quot; G@@ i@@ ve me some ad@@ v@@ ice for doing this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t put lim@@ it@@ ations on yourself .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t b@@ et against yourself ,
and take ris@@ ks . &quot;
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has this ph@@ ra@@ se that they like : &quot; F@@ a@@ il@@ ure is not an op@@ tion . &quot;
But fa@@ il@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in expl@@ or@@ ation , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of fa@@ ith .
And no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that requ@@ i@@ red innov@@ ation was done without ris@@ k .
You have to be wil@@ ling to take those ris@@ ks .
So , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , fa@@ il@@ ure is an op@@ tion , but fe@@ ar is not . Thank you .
If I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is gre@@ ater that the sum of the parts ,
and instead of thinking about information over@@ lo@@ ad , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patter@@ ns p@@ op and we can see tr@@ ends that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se be in@@ vi@@ sible .
So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typ@@ ical mor@@ tal@@ ity ch@@ art organ@@ ized by age .
This t@@ ool that I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called P@@ i@@ vo@@ t , and with P@@ i@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can cho@@ ose to fil@@ ter in one particular c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ ths -- say , ac@@ ci@@ den@@ ts .
And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different patter@@ n that emer@@ ges .
This is because , in the mid@@ -@@ area here , people are at their most acti@@ ve , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
We can step back out again and then re@@ organ@@ i@@ ze the data by c@@ ause of death ,
seeing that cir@@ cul@@ ator@@ y dise@@ ases and cancer are the usu@@ al su@@ spec@@ ts , but not for everyone .
If we go a@@ head and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that ac@@ ci@@ den@@ ts are actually the gre@@ at@@ est c@@ ause that people have to be wor@@ r@@ ied about .
And if you dr@@ ill into that , it &apos;s e@@ speci@@ ally the case for men .
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like s@@ w@@ im@@ ming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ grap@@ hi@@ c .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for cont@@ ent as well ?
So what we have right here is the c@@ over of every single S@@ por@@ ts I@@ l@@ lu@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed .
It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
You can go back to your roo@@ ms and try this after my talk .
W@@ ith P@@ i@@ vo@@ t , you can dr@@ ill into a de@@ ca@@ de .
You can dr@@ ill into a particular year .
You can ju@@ mp right into a speci@@ fic issu@@ e .
So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the a@@ th@@ le@@ tes that have appe@@ ared in this issu@@ e , the sp@@ or@@ ts .
I &apos;m a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an , so I &apos;ll go a@@ head and I &apos;ll c@@ lic@@ k on that , which re@@ ve@@ als , for me , all the issu@@ es in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong &apos;s been a part of .
Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ c@@ ling ? &quot;
So I can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
And I see Gre@@ g Le@@ M@@ ond now .
And so you get the idea that when you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate over information this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ a@@ der , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not bro@@ w@@ sing .
You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
So I want to extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit cra@@ z@@ y .
What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia pa@@ ge and we reduc@@ ed it down to a little su@@ m@@ mar@@ y .
So the su@@ m@@ mar@@ y consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to in@@ dic@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
I &apos;m only sho@@ wing the top 500 most pop@@ u@@ lar W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia pa@@ ges right here .
But even in this lim@@ ited view , we can do a lot of things .
Right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ a@@ ins that are most pop@@ u@@ lar on W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia .
I &apos;m going to go a@@ head and sel@@ ect government .
Now , having sel@@ ected government , I can now see that the W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies that most f@@ requ@@ ently cor@@ resp@@ ond to that are T@@ i@@ me ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine People of the Y@@ e@@ ar .
So this is really important because this is an in@@ si@@ ght that was not con@@ tain@@ ed within any one W@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia pa@@ ge .
It &apos;s only possible to see that in@@ si@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these particular su@@ m@@ mar@@ ies , I can then dr@@ ill into the concept of T@@ i@@ me ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ e@@ ar , br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them .
So looking at these people , I can see that the maj@@ or@@ ity come from government ;
some have come from natural sci@@ ences ;
some , fe@@ wer still , have come from business --
there &apos;s my b@@ os@@ s --
and one has come from music .
And interest@@ ingly enough , B@@ on@@ o is also a TED P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ner .
So we can go , ju@@ mp , and take a look at all the TED P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ ners .
So you see , we &apos;re na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pa@@ ge@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ pa@@ ge , but at a high@@ er level of ab@@ str@@ action .
And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by surpri@@ se .
I &apos;m just sho@@ wing the New York T@@ im@@ es website here .
So P@@ i@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- I don &apos;t want to call it a bro@@ w@@ s@@ er ; it &apos;s really not a bro@@ w@@ s@@ er , but you can view web pa@@ ges with it -- and we bring that z@@ oo@@ ma@@ ble technology to every single web pa@@ ge like this .
So I can step back , p@@ op right back into a speci@@ fic sec@@ tion .
Now the reason why this is important is because , by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pa@@ ges in this way , I can look at my entire bro@@ w@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way .
So I can dr@@ ill into what I &apos;ve done over speci@@ fic time fra@@ mes .
Here , in fact , is the state of all the de@@ m@@ o that I just gave .
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er today .
And , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my search history --
here , I was doing some ne@@ pot@@ ist@@ ic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for B@@ ing , over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ vo@@ t .
And from these , I can dr@@ ill into the web pa@@ ge and just la@@ unch them again .
It &apos;s one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ pur@@ posed mul@@ ti@@ ple times , and in each case it makes the whole gre@@ ater than the sum of the parts with the data .
So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
We talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ lo@@ ad .
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
What if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the ha@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patter@@ ns that were o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se hi@@ dden ?
If we can do that , then instead of being tr@@ app@@ ed in data , we might actually extr@@ act information .
And , instead of de@@ aling just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
And if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wis@@ dom to be found .
So with that , I th@@ ank you .
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
I had somebody coun@@ t the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the tit@@ le publi@@ shed in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
There is a huge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happiness , am@@ ong re@@ se@@ arch@@ ers .
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people happ@@ ier .
But in sp@@ ite of all this fl@@ ood of work , there are sever@@ al c@@ og@@ n@@ itive tr@@ aps that sort of make it almost im@@ possible to think stra@@ ight about happiness .
And my talk today will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these c@@ og@@ n@@ itive tr@@ aps .
This ap@@ pl@@ ies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it ap@@ pl@@ ies to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as me@@ ss@@ ed up as anybody else is .
The first of these tr@@ aps is a rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ m@@ it complex@@ ity .
It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a use@@ ful word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular mean@@ ing to which we might re@@ str@@ ic@@ t it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to ad@@ op@@ t the more comp@@ lic@@ ated view of what wel@@ l-@@ being is .
The second tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between experience and me@@ mor@@ y ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
And those are two very different con@@ cep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mp@@ ed in the not@@ ion of happiness .
And the third is the foc@@ using illu@@ sion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any cir@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ec@@ ts wel@@ l-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its import@@ ance .
I mean , this is a real c@@ og@@ n@@ itive tra@@ p .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a quest@@ i@@ on-@@ and@@ -@@ answer se@@ s@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ por@@ ted a story ,
and that was a story --
He said he &apos;d been li@@ sten@@ ing to a sy@@ mp@@ hon@@ y , and it was absolu@@ tely g@@ l@@ or@@ ious music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful sc@@ ree@@ ching sound .
And then he ad@@ ded , really quite emot@@ ion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the me@@ mor@@ ies of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of g@@ l@@ or@@ ious music .
They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a me@@ mor@@ y ; the me@@ mor@@ y was ru@@ ined , and the me@@ mor@@ y was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to keep .
What this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
There is an experi@@ enc@@ ing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
It &apos;s the experi@@ enc@@ ing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es -- you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; Do@@ es it h@@ urt now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;
And then there is a re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ ore , and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the question , &quot; How have you been fe@@ eling l@@ ately ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
Th@@ ose are two very different en@@ tit@@ ies , the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the me@@ ss about the not@@ ion of happiness .
Now , the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
And that really star@@ ts with a ba@@ sic respon@@ se of our me@@ mor@@ ies -- it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ ately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
O@@ ur me@@ mor@@ y tel@@ ls us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experi@@ ences is a story .
And let me begin with one example .
This is an old study .
Th@@ ose are ac@@ tual pati@@ ents under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful proc@@ ed@@ ure .
I won &apos;t go into deta@@ il . It &apos;s no longer pa@@ in@@ ful these days , but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
They were asked to re@@ port on their pa@@ in every 60 sec@@ onds .
Here are two pati@@ ents ,
those are their recor@@ d@@ ings .
And you are asked , &quot; Wh@@ o of them su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very easy question .
C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more --
his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was longer , and every minu@@ te of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these pati@@ ents think they su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a surpri@@ se . The surpri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se me@@ mor@@ y of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were different , and because a very crit@@ ical part of the story is how it ends . And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stories is very inspir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ inc@@ t ... but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ tly wor@@ se than the other .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ a@@ k at the very end ;
it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ? Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in tot@@ al ? &quot;
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B , in me@@ mor@@ y .
Now this is a direc@@ t conflic@@ t between the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ ro@@ m the point of view of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a wor@@ se time .
Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually ran c@@ lin@@ ical experi@@ ments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
That will c@@ ause the pati@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ enc@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off , and you have the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his experience .
What defin@@ es a story ?
And that is true of the stories that me@@ mor@@ y del@@ i@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
What defin@@ es a story are changes , sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mom@@ ents and end@@ ings .
En@@ d@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding dom@@ in@@ ated .
Now , the experi@@ enc@@ ing self lives its life contin@@ u@@ ously .
It has mom@@ ents of experience , one after the other .
And you can ask : What happens to these mom@@ ents ?
And the answer is really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward :
They are lost for@@ ever .
I mean , most of the mom@@ ents of our life -- and I cal@@ cul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ olog@@ ical present is said to be about three sec@@ onds long ;
that means that , you know , in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them ;
in a m@@ ont@@ h , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 --
most of them don &apos;t leave a tr@@ ace .
M@@ ost of them are completely ig@@ nor@@ ed by the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens during these mom@@ ents of experience is our life .
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite resour@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding while we &apos;re on this e@@ arth .
And how to spend it would se@@ em to be rel@@ ev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us .
So we have the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ enc@@ ing self , and they &apos;re really quite dist@@ inc@@ t .
The bi@@ gge@@ st difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
F@@ ro@@ m the point of view of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation .
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
For the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , a tw@@ o-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the on@@ e-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new me@@ mor@@ ies ad@@ ded .
You have not changed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the crit@@ ical vari@@ able that dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ he@@ s a re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ enc@@ ing self ;
time has very little impact on the story .
Now , the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
It is actually the one that makes deci@@ sions because , if you have a pati@@ ent who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to cho@@ ose , then the one that cho@@ os@@ es is the one that has the me@@ mor@@ y that is less bad , and that &apos;s the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en .
The experi@@ enc@@ ing self has no vo@@ ice in this cho@@ ice .
We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experi@@ ences ,
we cho@@ ose between me@@ mor@@ ies of experi@@ ences . And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future norm@@ ally as experi@@ ences .
We think of our future as anti@@ cip@@ ated me@@ mor@@ ies .
And basically you can look at this , you know , as a t@@ y@@ ran@@ ny of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ enc@@ ing self through experi@@ ences that the experi@@ enc@@ ing self doesn &apos;t need . I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very f@@ requ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ t@@ ent , in the serv@@ ice of our re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
And this is a bit hard to ju@@ sti@@ f@@ y I think .
I mean , how much do we consu@@ me our me@@ mor@@ ies ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
And when I think about that , I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was c@@ lear@@ ly the best v@@ ac@@ ation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it rel@@ ati@@ vely often , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ations .
And I probably have consu@@ m@@ ed my me@@ mor@@ ies of that th@@ ree@@ -@@ week tri@@ p , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I had ever open@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pic@@ tures in it , I would have spent another h@@ our .
Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a half .
There seem@@ s to be a disc@@ re@@ p@@ anc@@ y .
Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little appe@@ t@@ ite I have for consu@@ ming me@@ mor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much we@@ ight on me@@ mor@@ y rel@@ ative to the we@@ ight that we put on experi@@ ences ?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
I@@ ma@@ gine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tures will be de@@ stro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ sic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
Now , would you cho@@ ose the same v@@ ac@@ ation ? And if you would cho@@ ose a different v@@ ac@@ ation , there is a conflic@@ t between your two selves ,
and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflic@@ t ,
and it &apos;s actually not at all obvi@@ ous , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer ,
and if you think in terms of me@@ mor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
Why do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that conf@@ ron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
Now , the two selves bring up two not@@ ions of happiness .
There are really two con@@ cep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self .
So you can ask : How happy is the experi@@ enc@@ ing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mom@@ ents in the experi@@ enc@@ ing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all -- happiness for mom@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ lic@@ ated process .
What are the emot@@ ions that can be meas@@ u@@ red ?
And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self over time .
If you ask for the happiness of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
This is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
It is about how s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied or ple@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
Ver@@ y different not@@ ion .
An@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish those not@@ ions is going to me@@ ss up the study of happiness , and I bel@@ ong to a cro@@ w@@ d of students of wel@@ l-@@ being , who &apos;ve been me@@ ss@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in prec@@ is@@ ely this way .
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between the happiness of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to meas@@ ure the two se@@ par@@ ately . The G@@ all@@ up O@@ r@@ gan@@ ization has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experi@@ ences ,
and there have been other ef@@ for@@ ts along those lin@@ es .
So in rec@@ ent years , we have beg@@ un to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
And the ma@@ in le@@ ss@@ on I think that we have learned is they are really different .
You can know how s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t te@@ ach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and v@@ ice vers@@ a .
Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 .
What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
Well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
You have that much un@@ certain@@ ty . If I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ enc@@ ing self .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
We know that happiness is ma@@ in@@ ly being s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like .
There are other ple@@ as@@ ures , but this is dom@@ in@@ ant .
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for wel@@ l-@@ being .
It is a completely different not@@ ion .
Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in Californi@@ a , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer .
When you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in Californi@@ a if , say , you live in O@@ hi@@ o .
And what happens is when you think about living in Californi@@ a , you are thinking of the con@@ tra@@ st between Californi@@ a and other places , and that con@@ tra@@ st , say , is in climate .
Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the ref@@ lec@@ tive self that dec@@ ide@@ s how happy people are .
But now , because the ref@@ lec@@ tive self is in char@@ ge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to Californi@@ a .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happen to people who move to Californi@@ a in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
Well , their experi@@ enc@@ ing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
We know that .
But one thing will happen : They will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how hor@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o ,
and they will feel they made the right deci@@ sion .
It is very difficult to think stra@@ ight about wel@@ l-@@ being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Chris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting resul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y .
Is that something you can share since you do have a few mom@@ ents left now ?
Dan@@ iel K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man : S@@ ure . I think the most interesting resul@@ t that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y is a number , which we absolu@@ tely did not exp@@ ect to find .
We found that with resp@@ ect to the happiness of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self .
When we looked at how fe@@ el@@ ings , v@@ ary with in@@ come .
And it turns out that , bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Amer@@ ic@@ ans -- and that &apos;s a very large sa@@ mp@@ le of Amer@@ ic@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large represen@@ t@@ ative sa@@ mp@@ le -- bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ...
CA : 6@@ 0,000 . D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 . 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get pro@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the p@@ oor@@ er they get .
A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an absolu@@ tely fl@@ at line .
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lin@@ es so fl@@ at .
C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happiness , but l@@ ack of money certain@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y , and we can meas@@ ure that mis@@ er@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly .
In terms of the other self , the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
The more money you ear@@ n , the more s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ied you are .
That does not hold for emot@@ ions .
CA : But Dan@@ ny , the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , li@@ ber@@ ty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness .
If people took ser@@ i@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seem@@ s to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y and so for@@ th .
Is there any chan@@ ce that polit@@ ici@@ ans , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a fin@@ ding like that ser@@ i@@ ously and run public po@@ lic@@ y based on it ?
D@@ K : You know I think that there is recog@@ n@@ ition of the ro@@ le of happiness research in public po@@ lic@@ y .
The recog@@ n@@ ition is going to be s@@ low in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.@@ K@@ . , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
People are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public po@@ lic@@ y .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life e@@ valu@@ ation , so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate fa@@ ir@@ ly s@@ oon .
How to en@@ han@@ ce happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self .
This is going to inf@@ lu@@ ence po@@ lic@@ y , I think , in years to come .
In the United States , ef@@ for@@ ts are being made to meas@@ ure the experience happiness of the population .
This is going to be , I think , within the next de@@ ca@@ de or two , part of national statist@@ ics .
CA : Well , it seem@@ s to me that this issu@@ e will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting po@@ lic@@ y discus@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years .
Thank you so much for inven@@ ting behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics .
Thank you , Dan@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
And that might se@@ em a bit surpri@@ sing because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the F@@ ound@@ ation is mo@@ st@@ ly about vacc@@ ines and se@@ eds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and del@@ i@@ ver to help the p@@ oor@@ est two billion live better lives .
But energy and climate are extre@@ m@@ ely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to any@@ one else on the planet .
The climate getting wor@@ se means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow :
There will be too much ra@@ in , not enough ra@@ in ,
things will change in ways that their fra@@ g@@ ile environment simply can &apos;t sup@@ port .
And that lea@@ ds to star@@ v@@ ation , it lea@@ ds to un@@ certain@@ ty , it lea@@ ds to un@@ rest .
So , the climate changes will be ter@@ ri@@ ble for them .
Al@@ so , the pr@@ ice of energy is very important to them .
In fact , if you could pic@@ k just one thing to lo@@ wer the pr@@ ice of , to reduc@@ e p@@ over@@ ty , by far you would pic@@ k energy .
Now , the pr@@ ice of energy has come down over time .
Re@@ ally ad@@ van@@ ced civi@@ li@@ z@@ ation is based on ad@@ van@@ ces in energy .
The co@@ al revolu@@ tion fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very r@@ ap@@ id dec@@ line in the pr@@ ice of electr@@ ic@@ ity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ ors , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make moder@@ n materi@@ als and do so many things .
And so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situ@@ ation with electr@@ ic@@ ity in the r@@ ich world .
But , as we make it che@@ ap@@ er -- and let &apos;s go for making it tw@@ ice as ch@@ ea@@ p -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with CO@@ 2 .
CO@@ 2 is war@@ ming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on CO@@ 2 is actually a very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward one .
If you sum up the CO@@ 2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that lea@@ ds to a temperat@@ ure incre@@ ase , and that temperat@@ ure incre@@ ase lea@@ ds to some very neg@@ ative effec@@ ts :
the effec@@ ts on the we@@ a@@ ther ; perhaps wor@@ se , the in@@ direc@@ t effec@@ ts , in that the natural ec@@ osy@@ ste@@ ms can &apos;t ad@@ just to these r@@ ap@@ id changes , and so you get ec@@ osy@@ stem col@@ lap@@ ses .
Now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain incre@@ ase of CO@@ 2 to what temperat@@ ure will be and where the pos@@ itive fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
And there &apos;s certain@@ ly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effec@@ ts will be , but they will be extre@@ m@@ ely bad .
I asked the top scienti@@ sts on this sever@@ al times :
Do we really have to get down to ne@@ ar zer@@ o ?
Can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a qu@@ ar@@ ter ?
And the answer is that until we get ne@@ ar to zer@@ o , the temperat@@ ure will contin@@ ue to ri@@ se .
And so that &apos;s a big challen@@ ge .
It &apos;s very different than saying &quot; We &apos;re a tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ foo@@ t-@@ high tru@@ c@@ k trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ f@@ oot bri@@ dge , and we can just sort of squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze under . &quot;
This is something that has to get to zer@@ o .
Now , we put out a lot of carb@@ on di@@ ox@@ ide every year , over 2@@ 6 billion t@@ ons .
For each American , it &apos;s about 20 t@@ ons ;
for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
It &apos;s an aver@@ age of about five t@@ ons for everyone on the planet .
And , some@@ how , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zer@@ o .
It &apos;s been con@@ stan@@ tly going up .
It &apos;s only vari@@ ous economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly ri@@ sing to f@@ all@@ ing , and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to zer@@ o .
This equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors ,
a little bit of mul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ation :
So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO@@ 2 , that you want to get to zer@@ o , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the serv@@ ices each person &apos;s using on aver@@ age , the energy on aver@@ age for each serv@@ ice , and the CO@@ 2 being put out per un@@ it of energy .
So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zer@@ o .
Pro@@ b@@ ably , one of these nu@@ mbers is going to have to get pretty ne@@ ar to zer@@ o .
Now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ geb@@ ra , but let &apos;s take a look .
F@@ ir@@ st , we &apos;ve got population .
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
That &apos;s he@@ a@@ ded up to about n@@ ine billion .
Now , if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ ines , health care , re@@ produc@@ tive health serv@@ ices , we could lo@@ wer that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3 .
The second fac@@ tor is the serv@@ ices we use .
This en@@ compas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , c@@ lo@@ thing , T@@ V , he@@ ating .
These are very good things : getting ri@@ d of p@@ over@@ ty means provi@@ ding these serv@@ ices to almost everyone on the planet .
And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
In the r@@ ich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on aver@@ age , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than d@@ ou@@ ble the serv@@ ices del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed per person .
Here we have a very ba@@ sic serv@@ ice :
Do you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your h@@ ome@@ work ? And , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and rea@@ ding their school work under the stre@@ et la@@ mp@@ s .
Now , effici@@ enc@@ y , E , the energy for each serv@@ ice ,
here finally we have some good news .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Th@@ rou@@ gh vari@@ ous inven@@ tions and new ways of doing li@@ gh@@ ting , through different typ@@ es of c@@ ars , different ways of building buil@@ d@@ ings --
there are a lot of serv@@ ices where you can bring the energy for that serv@@ ice down quite sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally .
Some individu@@ al serv@@ ices even bring it down by 90 percent .
There are other serv@@ ices like how we make fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ er , or how we do air transp@@ ort , where the roo@@ ms for im@@ pro@@ vement are far , far less .
And so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic , we may get a reduc@@ tion of a fac@@ tor of three to even , perhaps , a fac@@ tor of six .
But for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 2@@ 6 billion to , at best , maybe 1@@ 3 billion t@@ ons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
So let &apos;s look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO@@ 2 put out per each un@@ it of energy .
And so the question is : Can you actually get that to zer@@ o ?
If you bur@@ n co@@ al , no .
If you bur@@ n natural gas , no .
Al@@ most every way we make electr@@ ic@@ ity today , ex@@ cept for the emer@@ ging ren@@ e@@ wa@@ b@@ les and nucle@@ ar , pu@@ ts out CO@@ 2 .
And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
And so , we need energy m@@ ir@@ ac@@ les .
Now , when I use the term &quot; m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s im@@ possible .
The micro@@ proc@@ ess@@ or is a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le . The person@@ al computer is a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le .
The Internet and its serv@@ ices are a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le .
So , the people here have parti@@ cip@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many m@@ ir@@ ac@@ les .
U@@ su@@ ally , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le by a certain d@@ ate .
U@@ su@@ ally , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
This is a case where we actually have to dri@@ ve at full spe@@ ed and get a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le in a pretty ti@@ ght ti@@ mel@@ ine .
Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really cap@@ ture this ?
Is there some kind of natural illu@@ str@@ ation , some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b people &apos;s ima@@ gin@@ ation here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os , and some@@ how people en@@ jo@@ yed that .
It really got them in@@ volved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that rel@@ eas@@ ing fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies would be my cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
So here we have some natural fi@@ re@@ fl@@ ies .
I &apos;m told they don &apos;t b@@ ite ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
Now , there &apos;s all sor@@ ts of g@@ im@@ mic@@ ky solu@@ tions like that one , but they don &apos;t really ad@@ d up to much .
We need solu@@ tions -- either one or sever@@ al -- that have un@@ belie@@ v@@ able scale and un@@ belie@@ v@@ able reli@@ ability , and , al@@ though there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king , I really only see five that can ach@@ ieve the big nu@@ mbers .
I &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ o@@ ther@@ m@@ al , fu@@ sion , bi@@ o@@ fu@@ els .
Th@@ ose may make some cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion , and if they can do better than I exp@@ ect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant challen@@ ges .
Let &apos;s look first at the bur@@ ning f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els , either bur@@ ning co@@ al or bur@@ ning natural gas .
What you need to do there , seem@@ s like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not ,
and that &apos;s to take all the CO@@ 2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the f@@ lu@@ e , press@@ ur@@ i@@ ze it , create a li@@ qu@@ id , put it some@@ where , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
Now we have some p@@ il@@ ot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full per@@ cen@@ tage , that will be very tr@@ ick@@ y , and a@@ gre@@ e@@ ing on where these CO@@ 2 qu@@ an@@ tit@@ ies should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ g@@ he@@ st one here is this lon@@ g@@ -@@ term issu@@ e .
Wh@@ o &apos;s going to be sure ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is literally bil@@ lions of times lar@@ ger than any type of wa@@ ste you think of in terms of nucle@@ ar or other things ?
This is a lot of volu@@ me .
So that &apos;s a t@@ ough one .
N@@ ex@@ t would be nucle@@ ar .
It also has three big problems :
C@@ ost , parti@@ cul@@ arly in high@@ ly re@@ g@@ ul@@ ated countries , is high ;
the issu@@ e of the sa@@ fe@@ ty , really fe@@ eling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ at@@ ors , that the fu@@ el doesn &apos;t get used for we@@ ap@@ ons .
And then what do you do with the wa@@ ste ?
And , al@@ though it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of con@@ cer@@ ns about that .
People need to feel good about it .
So three very t@@ ough problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be worked on .
The last three of the five , I &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
These are what people often ref@@ er to as the ren@@ e@@ wa@@ ble sour@@ ces .
And they actually -- al@@ though it &apos;s great they don &apos;t requ@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some di@@ sa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ges .
One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy ga@@ ther@@ ed in these technologies is dra@@ mat@@ ically less than a power pl@@ ant .
This is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many squ@@ are miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a norm@@ al energy pl@@ ant .
Al@@ so , these are inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent sour@@ ces .
The su@@ n doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
And so , if you de@@ p@@ end on these sour@@ ces , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ o@@ ds that it &apos;s not a@@ va@@ il@@ able .
So , we &apos;ve got big cost challen@@ ges here ,
we have trans@@ mis@@ sion challen@@ ges :
for example , say this energy sour@@ ce is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the ris@@ k of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
And , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
And , to dimen@@ sion@@ alize this , I went through and looked at all the typ@@ es of bat@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for c@@ ars , for computers , for ph@@ ones , for fla@@ sh@@ li@@ ghts , for everything -- and comp@@ ared that to the amount of electr@@ ical energy the world us@@ es , and what I found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could stor@@ e less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
And so , in fact , we need a big brea@@ k@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the appro@@ ach@@ es we have now .
It &apos;s not im@@ possible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
Now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent sour@@ ce to be ab@@ o@@ ve , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
If you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le bat@@ ter@@ y .
Now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right appro@@ ach ?
Is it a M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an Pro@@ ject ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
Well , we need lots of compan@@ ies working on this , hun@@ dre@@ ds .
In each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hun@@ d@@ red people .
And a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re cra@@ z@@ y . &quot; That &apos;s good .
And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
B@@ ill G@@ ross has sever@@ al compan@@ ies , inclu@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ m@@ al technologies .
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ la &apos;s inve@@ sting in do@@ z@@ ens of compan@@ ies that are doing great things and have interesting pos@@ sibil@@ ities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and I actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpri@@ sing@@ ly , is actually taking the nucle@@ ar appro@@ ach .
There are some innov@@ ations in nucle@@ ar : mo@@ du@@ lar , li@@ qu@@ id .
And innov@@ ation really stop@@ ped in this indu@@ stry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surpri@@ sing .
The idea of Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer is that , instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ an@@ ium -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s bur@@ n the 9@@ 9 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
It is kind of a cra@@ z@@ y idea .
In fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly whether it would work or not ,
and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ v@@ ent of moder@@ n super@@ computers that now you can simul@@ ate and see that , y@@ es ,
with the right mater@@ ial &apos;s appro@@ ach , this looks like it would work .
And , because you &apos;re bur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 percent , you have gre@@ at@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ved cost pro@@ fil@@ e .
You actually bur@@ n up the wa@@ ste , and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver wa@@ ste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors .
So , instead of wor@@ r@@ ying about them , you just take that . It &apos;s a great thing .
It brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ an@@ ium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
You can see it &apos;s a log there , often re@@ fer@@ red to as a tra@@ vel@@ ing wa@@ ve re@@ ac@@ tor .
In terms of fu@@ el , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in Ken@@ tu@@ c@@ ky .
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 9@@ 9 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they bur@@ n now ,
so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ an@@ ium .
That would power the U.S. for hun@@ dre@@ ds of years .
And , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ exp@@ en@@ sive process , you &apos;d have enough fu@@ el for the entire li@@ fe@@ time of the rest of the planet .
So , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challen@@ ges a@@ head , but it is an example of the many hun@@ dre@@ ds and hun@@ dre@@ ds of ideas that we need to move forward .
So let &apos;s think : How should we meas@@ ure ourselves ?
What should our re@@ port c@@ ard look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
For 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduc@@ tion .
That really is very important , that we get there .
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some a@@ gr@@ icul@@ ture ,
hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up for@@ est@@ ry , ce@@ ment .
So , to get to that 80 percent , the develop@@ ed countries , inclu@@ ding countries like China , will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their electr@@ ic@@ ity gener@@ ation al@@ together .
So , the other gra@@ de is : A@@ re we de@@ p@@ lo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ em@@ is@@ sion technology , have we de@@ p@@ lo@@ yed it in all the develop@@ ed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
That &apos;s su@@ per important .
That &apos;s a key ele@@ ment of making that re@@ port c@@ ard .
So , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ port c@@ ard look like ?
Well , again , it should have the two ele@@ ments .
We should go through these effici@@ enc@@ y meas@@ ures to start getting reduc@@ tions :
The less we em@@ it , the less that sum will be of CO@@ 2 , and , ther@@ ef@@ ore , the less the temperat@@ ure .
But in some ways , the gra@@ de we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reduc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even sli@@ gh@@ tly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innov@@ ation on these brea@@ k@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
These brea@@ k@@ throu@@ gh@@ s , we need to move those at full spe@@ ed , and we can meas@@ ure that in terms of compan@@ ies , p@@ il@@ ot projec@@ ts , re@@ g@@ ul@@ ator@@ y things that have been changed .
There &apos;s a lot of great books that have been wr@@ itten about this .
The Al G@@ ore book , &quot; O@@ ur C@@ ho@@ ice &quot; and the David Mc@@ K@@ ay book , &quot; Su@@ sta@@ in@@ able En@@ erg@@ y W@@ i@@ th@@ out the Ho@@ t A@@ ir . &quot;
They really go through it and create a fra@@ me@@ work that this can be discus@@ sed bro@@ ad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
So this is a w@@ ish .
It &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te w@@ ish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
If you gave me only one w@@ ish for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k who &apos;s pre@@ si@@ dent , I could pic@@ k a vacc@@ ine , which is something I love , or I could pic@@ k that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO@@ 2 gets inven@@ ted -- this is the w@@ ish I would pic@@ k .
This is the one with the gre@@ at@@ est impact .
If we don &apos;t get this w@@ ish , the divi@@ sion between the people who think short term and long term will be ter@@ ri@@ ble , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and r@@ ich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far wor@@ se .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I appe@@ aling to you to step forward and dri@@ ve ?
We need to go for more research fun@@ ding .
When countries get together in places like C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen , they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t just discus@@ s the CO@@ 2 .
They should discus@@ s this innov@@ ation a@@ gen@@ da , and you &apos;d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously low le@@ vel@@ s of sp@@ en@@ ding on these innov@@ ative appro@@ ach@@ es .
We do need the market in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves -- CO@@ 2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that gets that pr@@ ice sign@@ al out there .
We need to get the mes@@ sa@@ ge out .
We need to have this di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e be a more r@@ ational , more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e , inclu@@ ding the ste@@ ps that the government takes .
This is an important w@@ ish , but it is one I think we can ach@@ ieve .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . So to understand more about Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of inve@@ st@@ ment this is ?
B@@ il G@@ ates : To actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scienti@@ sts , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only t@@ ens of mil@@ lions , and even once we test our materi@@ als out in a Rus@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ tor to make sure that our materi@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hun@@ dre@@ ds of mil@@ lions .
The t@@ ough thing is building the p@@ il@@ ot re@@ ac@@ tor ; fin@@ ding the sever@@ al billion , fin@@ ding the re@@ g@@ ul@@ ator , the loc@@ ation that will actually build the first one of these .
On@@ ce you get the first one built , if it works as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the econom@@ ics , the energy den@@ s@@ ity , are so different than nucle@@ ar as we know it .
CA : And so , to understand it right , this in@@ vol@@ ves building de@@ ep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of col@@ um@@ n of nucle@@ ar fu@@ el , of this sort of spent ur@@ an@@ ium , and then the process star@@ ts at the top and kind of works down ?
B@@ G : That &apos;s right . To@@ day , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ eling the re@@ ac@@ tor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re open@@ ing it up and moving things in and out ,
that &apos;s not good .
So , if you have very ch@@ ea@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complex@@ ities .
And it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : It &apos;s a nucle@@ ar power pl@@ ant that is its own wa@@ ste disp@@ os@@ al solution .
B@@ G : Yeah . Well , what happens with the wa@@ ste , you can let it s@@ it there -- there &apos;s a lot less wa@@ ste under this appro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and bur@@ n that .
And we start off actually by taking the wa@@ ste that ex@@ ists today , that &apos;s sitting in these coo@@ ling p@@ ools or dr@@ y c@@ as@@ king by re@@ ac@@ tors --
that &apos;s our fu@@ el to begin with .
So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re reduc@@ ing the volu@@ me of the wa@@ ste quite dra@@ mat@@ ically as you &apos;re going through this process .
CA : I mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the pos@@ sibil@@ ities here . W@@ here is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with this ?
B@@ G : Well , we haven &apos;t pic@@ ked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disc@@ los@@ ure ru@@ les about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nucle@@ ar , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of inter@@ est , that people from the company have been in Rus@@ sia , India , China --
I &apos;ve been back seeing the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy a@@ gen@@ da .
So I &apos;m op@@ ti@@ mi@@ stic . You know , the F@@ ren@@ ch and Jap@@ an@@ ese have done some work .
This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
It &apos;s an important ad@@ van@@ ce , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ ac@@ tor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ ac@@ tor is a can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to be where the first one gets built .
CA : So , in your mind , ti@@ me@@ scale and li@@ kel@@ i@@ h@@ ood of actually taking something like this live ?
B@@ G : Well , we need -- for one of these high@@ -@@ scale , elec@@ tro@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that &apos;s very ch@@ ea@@ p , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y .
That &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environ@@ mental model@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to meet .
And , you know , Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , if things go well -- which is wis@@ h@@ ing for a lot -- could eas@@ ily meet that .
And there are , fortun@@ ately now , do@@ z@@ ens of compan@@ ies -- we need it to be hun@@ dre@@ ds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , if their science goes well , if the fun@@ ding for their p@@ il@@ ot plan@@ ts goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
And it &apos;s best if mul@@ ti@@ ple succ@@ e@@ ed , because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things .
We certain@@ ly need one to succ@@ e@@ ed .
CA : In terms of bi@@ g@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the bi@@ gge@@ st that you &apos;re a@@ ware of out there ?
B@@ G : A@@ n energy brea@@ k@@ through is the most important thing .
It would have been , even without the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much gre@@ ater .
In the nucle@@ ar space , there are other innov@@ at@@ ors .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ du@@ lar people , that &apos;s a different appro@@ ach .
There &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ type re@@ ac@@ tor , which seem@@ s a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
And so , there are different ones , but the beau@@ ty of this is a molecu@@ le of ur@@ an@@ ium has a million times as much energy as a molecu@@ le of , say , co@@ al , and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ ati@@ ves , which are essenti@@ ally the radi@@ ation -- the foo@@ t@@ pr@@ int and cost , the pot@@ ential , in terms of effect on land and vari@@ ous things , is almost in a cla@@ ss of its own .
CA : If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
Do we have to start taking emer@@ gen@@ c@@ y meas@@ ures to try and keep the temperat@@ ure of the e@@ arth st@@ able ?
B@@ G : If you get into that situ@@ ation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ e@@ ating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart att@@ ack :
Then where do you go ? You may need heart sur@@ ger@@ y or something .
There is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engin@@ eer@@ ing , which are vari@@ ous tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
Now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y .
You hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
Some people say you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y , that you &apos;ll keep e@@ ating because you know heart sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to sa@@ ve you .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wi@@ se , given the import@@ ance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engin@@ eer@@ ing discus@@ sion about -- should that be in the back p@@ oc@@ ket in case things happen fa@@ ster , or this innov@@ ation goes a lot s@@ lo@@ wer than we exp@@ ect ?
CA : C@@ lim@@ ate s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s : If you had a sen@@ ten@@ ce or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ a@@ de them that they &apos;re wrong ?
B@@ G : Well , un@@ fortun@@ ately , the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s come in different cam@@ ps .
The ones who make scienti@@ fic argu@@ ments are very few .
A@@ re they saying that there &apos;s neg@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back effec@@ ts that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chan@@ ce in a million of those things .
The ma@@ in problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like AI@@ D@@ S .
You make the mi@@ sta@@ ke now , and you pa@@ y for it a lot later .
And so , when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ gen@@ t problems , the idea of taking pa@@ in now that has to do with a ga@@ in later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pa@@ in thing --
in fact , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily the wor@@ st case , and there are people in the r@@ ich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
The fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us to@@ wards this .
But my dre@@ am here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO@@ 2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO@@ 2 , I kind of w@@ ish it did put out CO@@ 2 , but I gu@@ ess I &apos;ll ac@@ cept it because it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
CA : And so , that would be your respon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g argu@@ ment , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to sol@@ ve the CO@@ 2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of p@@ over@@ ty and mal@@ aria and so for@@ th ,
it &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id wa@@ ste of the Earth &apos;s resour@@ ces to put money to@@ wards that when there are better things we can do .
B@@ G : Well , the ac@@ tual sp@@ en@@ ding on the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ mati@@ c .
It sh@@ ouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can di@@ sa@@ gre@@ e , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fu@@ nd that --
that , to me , mo@@ st@@ ly is a wa@@ ste .
Un@@ less you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fun@@ ding the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very ch@@ ea@@ p ,
I believe we should try more things that have a pot@@ ential to be far less exp@@ en@@ sive .
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is , &quot; Let &apos;s make energy su@@ per exp@@ en@@ sive , &quot; then the r@@ ich can af@@ ford that .
I mean , all of us here could pa@@ y five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ le .
The di@@ sa@@ ster is for that two billion .
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
H@@ is sh@@ tic@@ k now is , &quot; Why isn &apos;t the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D getting more discus@@ sed ? &quot;
He &apos;s still , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stuff , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic cam@@ p , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely cam@@ p , and so , he &apos;s making the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D point .
And so there is a th@@ read of something that I think is appro@@ pri@@ ate .
The R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D piece , it &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y how little it &apos;s fun@@ ded .
CA : Well B@@ ill , I su@@ sp@@ ect I spea@@ k on the be@@ half of most people here to say I really hope your w@@ ish comes true . Thank you so much .
B@@ G : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a disc@@ o@@ very that I made a few months ago while wr@@ iting an ar@@ tic@@ le for I@@ tal@@ ian W@@ i@@ red .
I always keep my the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us hand@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I &apos;m wr@@ iting anything , but I &apos;d already fin@@ is@@ hed e@@ di@@ ting the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
Let me read you the en@@ try .
&quot; D@@ is@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ jec@@ tive : c@@ ri@@ p@@ ple@@ d , hel@@ ple@@ ss , u@@ sel@@ ess , w@@ rec@@ ked , st@@ alled , ma@@ im@@ ed , w@@ oun@@ ded , man@@ g@@ led , la@@ me , mu@@ t@@ il@@ ated , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , we@@ a@@ ken@@ ed , imp@@ ot@@ ent , ca@@ str@@ ated , par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , han@@ dic@@ app@@ ed , sen@@ ile , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , la@@ id@@ -@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out ; see also h@@ urt , u@@ sel@@ ess and we@@ a@@ k .
An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , heal@@ thy , str@@ ong , cap@@ able . &quot;
I was rea@@ ding this li@@ st out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s , but I &apos;d just g@@ ot@@ ten past &quot; man@@ g@@ led , &quot; and my vo@@ ice bro@@ ke , and I had to stop and collec@@ t myself from the emot@@ ion@@ al sho@@ c@@ k and impact that the as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t from these words un@@ le@@ as@@ hed .
You know , of course , this is my ra@@ gge@@ dy old the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us
so I &apos;m thinking this must be an anci@@ ent pr@@ int d@@ ate , right ?
But , in fact , the pr@@ int d@@ ate was the early 19@@ 8@@ 0s , when I would have been starting pri@@ mar@@ y school and form@@ ing an understanding of myself outside the family un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me .
And , ne@@ ed@@ less to say , th@@ ank God I wasn &apos;t using a the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us back then .
I mean , from this en@@ try , it would se@@ em that I was bor@@ n into a world that per@@ c@@ ei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing pos@@ itive what@@ s@@ oe@@ ver going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated for the opportun@@ ities and ad@@ ven@@ tures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
So , I im@@ medi@@ ately went to look up the 200@@ 9 online e@@ di@@ tion , exp@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ vi@@ sion wor@@ th not@@ ing .
Here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this en@@ try .
Un@@ fortun@@ ately , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two words under &quot; Ne@@ ar An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , &quot; parti@@ cul@@ arly un@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ o@@ le@@ some . &quot;
So , it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
It &apos;s about the valu@@ es behind the words , and how we construc@@ t those valu@@ es .
O@@ ur language aff@@ ec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
In fact , many anci@@ ent soc@@ ie@@ ties , inclu@@ ding the G@@ ree@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ ans , belie@@ ved that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into ex@@ ist@@ ence .
So , what real@@ ity do we want to call into ex@@ ist@@ ence : a person who is lim@@ ited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ power@@ ed ?
B@@ y c@@ as@@ u@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be pu@@ tting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
W@@ ouldn &apos;t we want to open door@@ s for them instead ?
One such person who open@@ ed door@@ s for me was my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood doc@@ tor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ stitu@@ te in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ el@@ a@@ ware .
H@@ is name was D@@ r@@ . P@@ iz@@ zu@@ t@@ ill@@ o ,
an I@@ tal@@ ian American , wh@@ ose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most Amer@@ ic@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by D@@ r@@ . P@@ .
And D@@ r@@ . P always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perfect disp@@ os@@ ition to work with children .
I lo@@ ved almost everything about my time spent at this h@@ osp@@ ital , with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of my phys@@ ical ther@@ ap@@ y se@@ s@@ sions .
I had to do what seem@@ ed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able re@@ pe@@ tit@@ ions of ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es with these th@@ ick , el@@ ast@@ ic b@@ ands -- different col@@ ors , you know -- to help build up my le@@ g mu@@ sc@@ les ,
and I h@@ ated these b@@ ands more than anything --
I h@@ ated them , had nam@@ es for them . I h@@ ated them .
And , you know , I was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year-@@ old child , with D@@ r@@ . P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es , un@@ succ@@ ess@@ ful@@ ly , of course .
And , one day , he came in to my se@@ s@@ sion -- ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ gi@@ ving , these se@@ s@@ sions -- and he said to me , &quot; W@@ ow . A@@ i@@ mee , you are such a str@@ ong and powerful little gir@@ l , I think you &apos;re going to brea@@ k one of those b@@ ands .
When you do brea@@ k it , I &apos;m going to give you a hun@@ d@@ red b@@ uc@@ ks . &quot;
Now , of course , this was a simple p@@ lo@@ y on D@@ r@@ . P &apos;s part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es I didn &apos;t want to do before the pr@@ osp@@ ect of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year-@@ old in the second fl@@ oor ward , but what he effec@@ ti@@ vely did for me was re@@ shape an a@@ w@@ ful da@@ ily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and prom@@ is@@ ing experience for me .
And I have to w@@ onder today to what ex@@ t@@ ent his vi@@ sion and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and powerful little gir@@ l sh@@ ap@@ ed my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently str@@ ong , powerful and a@@ th@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
This is an example of how ad@@ ul@@ ts in pos@@ iti@@ ons of power can ig@@ n@@ ite the power of a child .
But , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous in@@ stan@@ ces of those the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us en@@ tries , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to e@@ vol@@ ve into the real@@ ity that we would all want , the pos@@ sibility of an individu@@ al to see themselves as cap@@ able .
O@@ ur language ha@@ sn &apos;t cau@@ ght up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , from a medic@@ al stand@@ point , my le@@ gs , la@@ s@@ er sur@@ ger@@ y for vi@@ sion im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , tit@@ an@@ ium k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ e@@ ments for a@@ ging bo@@ dies that are allo@@ wing people to more ful@@ ly en@@ ga@@ ge with their abil@@ ities , and move be@@ y@@ ond the lim@@ its that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to men@@ tion social net@@ working plat@@ for@@ ms al@@ low people to self-@@ iden@@ ti@@ f@@ y , to cla@@ im their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with global grou@@ ps of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
So , perhaps technology is re@@ ve@@ aling more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has always been a tru@@ th : that everyone has something r@@ are and powerful to off@@ er our society , and that the human ability to ad@@ ap@@ t is our gre@@ at@@ est as@@ set .
The human ability to ad@@ ap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ u@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ versity , and I &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mis@@ sion :
This ph@@ ra@@ se never s@@ at right with me , and I always f@@ elt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
I@@ mp@@ lic@@ it in this ph@@ ra@@ se of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ versity &quot; is the idea that succ@@ ess , or happiness , is about emer@@ ging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience un@@ sc@@ a@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my succ@@ ess@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or cir@@ cu@@ m@@ na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the pre@@ su@@ m@@ ed p@@ it@@ f@@ al@@ ls of a life with pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic@@ s , or what other people per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
But , in fact , we are changed . We are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challen@@ ge , whether phys@@ ically , emot@@ ion@@ ally or both .
And I &apos;m going to sugge@@ st that this is a good thing .
A@@ d@@ versity isn &apos;t an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in order to re@@ su@@ me living our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I tend to think of it like my sha@@ do@@ w .
S@@ ome@@ times I see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , certain@@ ly , I &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the we@@ ight , of a person &apos;s stru@@ g@@ g@@ le .
There is ad@@ versity and challen@@ ge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and rel@@ ative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ versity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
So , our respon@@ sibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ versity , but pre@@ par@@ ing them to meet it well .
And we do a dis@@ serv@@ ice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equ@@ i@@ pp@@ ed to ad@@ ap@@ t .
There &apos;s an important difference and dist@@ inc@@ tion between the objec@@ tive medic@@ al fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ te@@ e and the sub@@ jec@@ tive soc@@ ie@@ tal op@@ in@@ ion of whether or not I &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
And , tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ly , the only real and consi@@ st@@ ent dis@@ ability I &apos;ve had to conf@@ ron@@ t is the world ever thinking that I could be descri@@ bed by those defin@@ iti@@ ons .
In our de@@ si@@ re to prot@@ ect those we care about by gi@@ ving them the c@@ old , hard tru@@ th about their medic@@ al pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is , or , in@@ deed , a pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is on the exp@@ ected qu@@ ality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first br@@ ick in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able someone .
Per@@ haps the ex@@ ist@@ ing model of only looking at what is bro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individu@@ al than the pa@@ th@@ ology itself .
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their pot@@ enc@@ y , we are cre@@ ating another ill on top of whatever natural stru@@ g@@ g@@ le they might have .
We are effec@@ ti@@ vely gra@@ ding someone &apos;s wor@@ th to our community .
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ ology and into the ran@@ ge of human cap@@ ability .
And , most import@@ an@@ tly , there &apos;s a part@@ ner@@ ship between those per@@ c@@ ei@@ ved de@@ f@@ ici@@ enc@@ ies and our gre@@ at@@ est cre@@ ative ability .
So it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to a@@ vo@@ id or s@@ we@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportun@@ ities wr@@ app@@ ed in the ad@@ versity .
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ versity as it is open@@ ing ourselves up to it , em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it , grap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ re@@ st@@ ling term , maybe even d@@ anc@@ ing with it .
And , perhaps , if we see ad@@ versity as natural , consi@@ st@@ ent and use@@ ful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presen@@ ce of it .
This year we cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate the 200@@ th bir@@ th@@ day of Char@@ les Dar@@ win , and it was 1@@ 50 years ago , when wr@@ iting about evolution , that Dar@@ win illu@@ str@@ ated , I think , a tru@@ th about the human charac@@ ter .
To par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se : It &apos;s not the str@@ onge@@ st of the species that survi@@ ves , no@@ r is it the most intelligen@@ t that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ table to change .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation .
F@@ ro@@ m Dar@@ win &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ g@@ st others , we can recogni@@ ze that the human ability to survi@@ ve and fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh is dri@@ ven by the stru@@ g@@ g@@ le of the human spir@@ it through conflic@@ t into transform@@ ation .
So , again , transform@@ ation , ad@@ ap@@ tation , is our gre@@ at@@ est human sk@@ ill .
And , perhaps , until we &apos;re te@@ sted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
Ma@@ ybe that &apos;s what ad@@ versity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
So , we can give ourselves a gi@@ ft .
We can re@@ -@@ imagine ad@@ versity as something more than just t@@ ough times .
Ma@@ ybe we can see it as change .
A@@ d@@ versity is just change that we haven &apos;t ad@@ ap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
I think the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ versity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of norm@@ al@@ c@@ y .
Now , who &apos;s norm@@ al ?
There &apos;s no norm@@ al .
There &apos;s common , there &apos;s typ@@ ical . There &apos;s no norm@@ al ,
and would you want to meet that poor , be@@ ige person if they ex@@ ist@@ ed ?
I don &apos;t think so .
If we can change this para@@ dig@@ m from one of ach@@ ie@@ ving norm@@ al@@ c@@ y to one of pos@@ sibility -- or pot@@ enc@@ y , to be even a little bit more dan@@ ger@@ ous -- we can rel@@ ea@@ se the power of so many more children , and inv@@ ite them to en@@ ga@@ ge their r@@ are and valu@@ able abil@@ ities with the community .
An@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as humans have always requ@@ i@@ red of our community me@@ mbers is to be of use , to be able to cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ te .
There &apos;s evi@@ dence that Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ r@@ ied their el@@ der@@ ly and those with ser@@ ious phys@@ ical in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survi@@ val of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community . They didn &apos;t view these people as bro@@ ken and u@@ sel@@ ess ; they were seen as r@@ are and valu@@ able .
A few years ago , I was in a food market in the to@@ wn where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , and I was standing over a bu@@ s@@ he@@ l of tom@@ at@@ o@@ es .
It was su@@ m@@ mer@@ time : I had sh@@ or@@ ts on .
I hear this guy , his vo@@ ice behind me say , &quot; Well , if it isn &apos;t A@@ i@@ mee M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
And I turn around , and it &apos;s this ol@@ der man . I have no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , si@@ r , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember mee@@ ting you . &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , you wouldn &apos;t remember mee@@ ting me .
I mean , when we met I was del@@ i@@ ver@@ ing you from your mother &apos;s w@@ om@@ b . &quot;
Oh , that guy .
And , but of course , actually , it did c@@ lic@@ k .
This man was D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an , a man that I had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typ@@ ical fas@@ hi@@ on , I ar@@ ri@@ ved l@@ ate for my bir@@ th@@ day by two weeks .
And so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al phys@@ ici@@ an had gone on v@@ ac@@ ation , so the man who del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed me was a comple@@ te str@@ an@@ ger to my parents .
And , because I was bor@@ n without the fi@@ b@@ ul@@ a b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this f@@ oot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ an@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bil@@ ity that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ depen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
The ex@@ tra@@ ordinary thing is that he said he had sa@@ ved ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er cli@@ pp@@ ings throu@@ gh@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood , whether win@@ ning a second gra@@ de spel@@ ling be@@ e , mar@@ ching with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the H@@ allo@@ w@@ een para@@ de , win@@ ning my colle@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my sp@@ or@@ ts v@@ ic@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating it into teach@@ ing resi@@ dent students , m@@ ed students from Ha@@ h@@ ne@@ man@@ n Me@@ dic@@ al Sch@@ ool and H@@ er@@ s@@ he@@ y Me@@ dic@@ al Sch@@ ool .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor , the pot@@ ential of the human will .
No pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is can ac@@ coun@@ t for how powerful this could be as a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ant in the qu@@ ality of someone &apos;s life .
And D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experience , un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , and even if given a mo@@ di@@ cu@@ m of sup@@ port , if left to their own dev@@ ices , a child will ach@@ ieve . &quot;
Se@@ e , D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thinking .
He under@@ st@@ ood that there &apos;s a difference between the medic@@ al condi@@ tion and what someone might do with it .
And there &apos;s been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have tra@@ ded pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic@@ s for fle@@ sh@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one le@@ gs , I wouldn &apos;t have he@@ sit@@ ated for a second .
I a@@ spi@@ red to that kind of norm@@ al@@ c@@ y back then .
But if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And it &apos;s because of the experi@@ ences I &apos;ve had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the experi@@ ences I &apos;ve had with them .
And perhaps this shi@@ ft in me has happened because I &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have open@@ ed door@@ s for me than those who have put li@@ ds and ca@@ st sha@@ do@@ ws on me .
Se@@ e , all you really need is one person to show you the ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spir@@ it is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ ci@@ al moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
You &apos;re teach@@ ing them to open door@@ s for themselves .
In fact , the ex@@ act mean@@ ing of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the r@@ oot word &quot; educ@@ e . &quot;
It means &quot; to bring for@@ th what is within , to bring out pot@@ ential . &quot;
So again , which pot@@ ential do we want to bring out ?
There was a case study done in 19@@ 6@@ 0s Brit@@ a@@ in , when they were moving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r sch@@ ools to comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sive sch@@ ools .
It &apos;s called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als . We call it &quot; trac@@ king &quot; here in the States .
It &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
And the &quot; A students &quot; get the tou@@ gh@@ er curr@@ icul@@ um , the best teach@@ ers , et@@ c .
Well , they took , over a th@@ ree@@ -@@ m@@ ont@@ h peri@@ od , D@@ -@@ level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were b@@ right ,
and at the end of this th@@ ree@@ -@@ m@@ ont@@ h peri@@ od , they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ level .
And , of course , the he@@ ar@@ t@@ brea@@ king , f@@ li@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; A students &quot; and told them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot;
And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that th@@ ree@@ -@@ m@@ ont@@ h peri@@ od .
Th@@ ose who were still around in school , be@@ si@@ des the people who had dro@@ pp@@ ed out .
A cru@@ ci@@ al part of this case study was that the teach@@ ers were du@@ ped too .
The teach@@ ers didn &apos;t know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been made .
They were simply told , &quot; These are the &apos; A@@ -@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; D@@ -@@ students . &apos; &quot;
And that &apos;s how they went about teach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them .
So , I think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cru@@ shed spir@@ it , a spir@@ it that &apos;s been cru@@ shed doesn &apos;t have hope ,
it doesn &apos;t see beau@@ ty ,
it no longer has our natural , chil@@ d@@ like cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity and our in@@ n@@ ate ability to imagine .
If instead , we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human spir@@ it to keep hope , to see beau@@ ty in themselves and others , to be cur@@ ious and ima@@ gin@@ ative , then we are tru@@ ly using our power well .
When a spir@@ it has those qu@@ al@@ ities , we are able to create new real@@ ities and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a p@@ oe@@ m by a f@@ our@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ century Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed H@@ af@@ i@@ z that my friend , J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is told me about ,
and the p@@ oe@@ m is called &quot; The God Wh@@ o On@@ ly K@@ no@@ ws F@@ our Wor@@ ds &quot; :
&quot; E@@ very child has known God , not the God of nam@@ es , not the God of don &apos;@@ ts , but the God who only knows four words and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; C@@ ome d@@ ance with me . C@@ ome , d@@ ance with me . C@@ ome , d@@ ance with me . &apos; &quot;
Thank you .
